    ``find_routes`` determines the shortest paths to visit the input stops and
    returns the driving directions, information about the visited stops,
    and the route paths, including travel time and distance. The tool is
    capable of finding routes that visit several input stops in a sequence
    you predetermine or in the  sequence that minimizes overall travel. You
    can group the input stops into different routes using the RouteName
    field, and the tool will output one route for each group of stops,
    allowing you to generate routes for many vehicles in a single solve
    operation.

    ======================================  ==========================================================================================================================================
    **Argument**                            **Description**
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    stops                                   Required FeatureSet. Specify the locations you want the output route
                                            or routes to visit. You can add up to 10,000 stops and assign up to 150 stops to a single
                                            route. (Assign stops to routes using the ``RouteName`` attribute). When specifying the stops,
                                            you can set properties for each one, such as its name or service time, by using
                                            attributes. 
                                            The stops can be specified with the following attributes:
                                              * ``Name``: The name of the stop. This name is used when generating driving directions. 
                                                It is common to pass the name of a business, person, or street address at the stop. 
                                                If a value is not specified, an automatically generated name such as Location 1 or 
                                                Location 2 is assigned to each stop.
                                              * ``TimeWindowStart``: The earliest time the stop can be visited. Specify this attribute if you want to limit when 
                                                a route can arrive at a stop; for instance, you may want to make deliveries to a restaurant between 
                                                busy lunch and dinner hours (for example, sometime between 2:00 and 4:30 p.m.) to facilitate the work 
                                                for you and the restaurant staff.

                                                The value is specified as an integer that represents the number of milliseconds since epoch (January 1, 1970).

                                                This value can be specified either in UTC or local time, depending on the value given for 
                                                the ``timeWindowsAreUTC`` parameter.

                                                If you specify this attribute, you also need to specify the ``TimeWindowEnd`` attribute.
                                              * ``TimeWindowEnd``: The latest time the stop can be visited. Together, the ``TimeWindowStart`` and ``TimeWindowEnd`` 
                                                attributes make up the time window within which a route can visit the stop. As with ``TimeWindowStart``, 
                                                the ``TimeWindowEnd`` value is specified as an integer that represents the number of milliseconds since 
                                                epoch (January 1, 1970) and is interpreted as UTC or local time, depending on the value specified for 
                                                the ``timeWindowsAreUTC`` parameter.

                                                The time window specified using the ``TimeWindowStart`` and ``TimeWindowEnd`` attributes is not considered a hard 
                                                constraint by the service. That is, the service doesn't fail if the stop cannot be visited during the time 
                                                window; instead, the service tries to find a route that visits the stop during its time window, but if time 
                                                window violations are inevitable, the service tries to find a solution that minimizes the time-window violation 
                                                time for all stops in the problem.

                                                If a route has to arrive early at the stop, a wait time is added to the total travel time of the route. 
                                                Similarly, if the route arrives late at the stop, a violation time is added to the total travel time of 
                                                the route. For example, If the time window on the stop is set as 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM and the earliest a 
                                                route can reach the stop is 11:25 AM, a violation of 25 minutes is added to the total travel time.
                                              * ``RouteName``: The name of the route to which the stop belongs. Use this attribute to group stops into different 
                                                routes and, therefore, solve multiple routes in a single request. For example, if you want to find two distinct 
                                                routes - a route with 4 stops and another with 6 stops - set RouteName to Route1 for each of the four stops and Route2 
                                                for each of the 6 stops. The service will produce two distinct routes and driving directions for each group of 
                                                stops in a single request.

                                                If ``RouteName`` is not specified for any stops, all stops belong to the same route. If ``RouteName`` is not 
                                                specified for some stops, those stops are treated as unassigned and are not included in any route.
                                              * ``Sequence``: The output routes will visit the stops in the order you specify with this
                                                attribute. Within a group of stops that have the same RouteName value, the sequence
                                                number should be greater than 0 but not greater than the total number of stops. Also, the
                                                sequence number should not be duplicated. If Reorder Stops To Find Optimal Routes is
                                                checked (True), all but possibly the first and last sequence values for each route name
                                                are ignored so the tool can find the sequence that minimizes overall travel for each
                                                route. (The settings for Preserve Ordering of Stops and Return to Start determine whether
                                                the first or last sequence values for each route are ignored.)
                                              * ``CurbApproach``: Specify the direction a vehicle may arrive at and depart from the stop. One of the 
                                                integers listed in the Coded value column in the following table must be specified as a value of this 
                                                attribute. The values in the Setting column are the descriptive names for the CurbApproach attribute 
                                                values that you may have come across when using ArcGIS Network Analyst extension extension software.

                                                The ``CurbApproach`` property is designed to work with both kinds of national driving standards: right-hand 
                                                traffic (United States) and left-hand traffic (United Kingdom). First, consider a stop on the left side of a vehicle. 
                                                It is always on the left side regardless of whether the vehicle travels on the left or right half of the road. What 
                                                may change with national driving standards is your decision to approach from the right or left side. For example, 
                                                if you want to arrive at a stop and not have a lane of traffic between the vehicle and the stop, you would choose 
                                                Right side of vehicle in the United States but Left side of vehicle in the United Kingdom.
                                              * ``Attr_TravelTime``: Specify the amount of time for cars, in minutes, that will be spent at the stop when 
                                                the route visits it. This attribute can be used to model the time required to provide some kind of service 
                                                while you are at the stop. It can also be used to specify some additional time required to reach the actual 
                                                location on the street from where the route starts or time required to reach the actual destination location 
                                                from the location on the street where the route ends. The value for this attribute is included in the total 
                                                travel time for the route and is also displayed in driving directions as service time. A zero or null value 
                                                indicates that the stop requires no service time.
                                                
                                                For example, suppose you are finding the best route through three stops. Suppose it requires 2 minutes to 
                                                walk to the street location from where the route starts, you need to spend 10 minutes at Stop 2, and it takes 5 
                                                minutes to walk from the street location to the destination. The Attr_TravelTime attribute should be given 
                                                values of 2, 10, and 5 for Stop 1, Stop 2, and Stop 3, respectively. If it takes 10 minutes to travel from Stop 
                                                1 to Stop 2 and 10 minutes to travel from Stop 2 to Stop 3, the total travel time to reach Stop 3 is displayed 
                                                as 37 minutes (2 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 5), even though there is only 20 minutes of traveling to reach Stop 3.
                                              * ``Attr_TruckTravelTime``: Specify the amount of time for trucks, in minutes, that will be added to the total 
                                                travel time of the route at the stop. The attribute value can be used to model the time spent at the stop.
                                                
                                                The value for this attribute is included in the total travel time for the route and is also displayed in 
                                                driving directions as service time. A zero or null value indicates that the incident requires no service time. 
                                                The default value is 0.
                                              * ``Attr_WalkTime``: Specify the amount of time for pedestrians, in minutes, that will be added to the total 
                                                travel time of the route at the stop. The attribute value can be used to model the time spent at the incident.
                                                The value for this attribute is included in the total travel time for the route and is also displayed in 
                                                driving directions as service time. A zero or null value indicates that the incident requires no service time. 
                                                The default value is 0.
                                              * ``Attr_Miles``: Specify the distance in miles that will be added when calculating total distance of the route. 
                                                Generally the locations of the stops are not exactly on the streets but are set back somewhat from the road. 
                                                The Attr_Miles attribute can be used to model the distance between the actual stop location and its location 
                                                on the street if it is important to include that distance in the total travel distance.
                                              * ``Attr_Kilometers``: Specify the distance in kilometers that will be added when calculating total 
                                                distance of the route. Generally the locations of the stops are not exactly on the streets but are set back 
                                                somewhat from the road. The Attr_Kilometers attribute can be used to model the distance between the actual 
                                                stop location and its location on the street if it is important to include that distance in the total travel distance.
                                              * ``LocationType``: The stop type.

                                              * ``Bearing``: Specify the direction the vehicle or person is moving in. Bearing is measured clockwise from 
                                                true north and must be in degrees. Typically, values are between 0 and 360; however, negative values are 
                                                interpreted by subtracting them from 360 degrees.

                                              * ``BearingTol``: Short for bearing tolerance, this field specifies the maximum acceptable difference between the

                                                vehicle. The bearing tolerance is used to determine whether the direction in which a vehicle is moving generally 
                                                aligns with the underlying road. If they align within the given tolerance, the vehicle is located on that edge;

                                            distance for the output routes. The units you choose for this parameter determine whether the tool will measure 
                                            distance or time to find the best routes. Choose a time unit to minimize travel time for your chosen travel 
                                            mode (driving or walking time, for instance). To minimize travel distance for the given travel mode, choose a 
                                            distance unit. Your choice also determines in which units the tool will report total time or distance in the results.

                                            it is the stop feature with the lowest Object ID value.
                                            
                                            Checked (True) - The route should start and end at the first 
                                            stop feature. This is the default value. When Reorder Stops to Find Optimal Routes and Return to Start are both 
                                            checked (or True), Preserve Terminal Stops must be set to Preserve First.
                                            
                                            Unchecked (False) - The route won't start and end at the first stop feature.
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    use_time_windows                        Optional boolean. Check this option (or set it to True) if any input stops have time windows that specify when 
                                            the route should reach the stop. You can add time windows to input stops by entering time values in the 
                                            ``TimeWindowStart`` and ``TimeWindowEnd`` attributes.
                                            
                                            Checked (True) - The input stops have time windows and you want the tool to try to honor them.

                                            Unchecked (False) - The input stops don't have time windows, or if they do, you don't want the tool to try to 
                                            honor them. This is the default value.The tool will take slightly longer to run when Use Time Windows is checked 
                                            (or True), even when none of the input stops have time windows, so it is recommended to uncheck this option 
                                            (set to False) if possible.

    time_of_day                             Optional datetime. Specifies the time and date at which the routes should
                                            begin. If you are modeling the driving travel mode and specify the current date and time as the value
                                            for this parameter, the tool will use live traffic conditions to
                                            find the best routes and the total travel time will be based
                                            on traffic conditions. Specifying a time of day results in more accurate
                                            routes and estimations of travel times because the
                                            travel times account for the traffic conditions that are applicable
                                            for that date and time.The Time Zone for Time of Day parameter specifies whether this time and date refer to 
                                            UTC or the time zone in which the stop is located.The tool ignores this parameter when Measurement Units isn't 
                                            set to a time-based unit.
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    time_zone_for_time_of_day               Optional string. Specifies the time zone of the Time of Day parameter.Geographically Local-The Time of Day 
                                            parameter refers to the time zone in which the first stop of a route is located. If you are generating many 
                                            routes that start in multiple times zones, the start times are staggered in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). 
                                            For example, a Time of Day value of 10:00 a.m., 2 January, would mean a start time of 10:00 a.m. Eastern Standard 
                                            Time (UTC-3:00) for routes beginning in the Eastern Time Zone and 10:00 a.m. Central Standard Time (UTC-4:00) for 
                                            routes beginning in the Central Time Zone. The start times are offset by one hour in UTC. The arrive and depart 
                                            times and dates recorded in the output Stops feature class will refer to the local time zone of the first stop 
                                            for each route.UTC-The Time of Day parameter refers to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Choose this option if 
                                            you want to generate a route for a specific time, such as now, but aren't certain in which time zone the first 
                                            stop will be located. If you are generating many routes spanning multiple times zones, the start times in UTC are 
                                            simultaneous. For example, a Time of Day value of 10:00 a.m., 2 January, would mean a start time of 5:00 a.m. 
                                            Eastern Standard Time (UTC-5:00) for routes beginning in the Eastern Time Zone and 4:00 a.m. Central Standard 
                                            Time (UTC-6:00) for routes beginning in the Central Time Zone. Both routes would start at 10:00 a.m. UTC. The 
                                            arrive and depart times and dates recorded in the output Stops feature class will refer to UTC.

    uturn_at_junctions                      Optional string. Use this parameter to restrict or permit the service area to make U-turns at junctions. 
                                            In order to understand the parameter values, consider for a moment the following terminology: a junction is 
                                            a point where a street segment ends and potentially connects to one or more other segments; a pseudo-junction is 
                                            a point where exactly two streets connect to one another; an intersection is a point where three or more streets 
                                            connect; and a  dead-end is where one street segment ends without connecting to another. Given this information, 
                                            the parameter can have the following values:
                                            
                                            Choice list:['ALLOW_UTURNS', 'NO_UTURNS', 'ALLOW_DEAD_ENDS_ONLY', 'ALLOW_DEAD_ENDS_AND_INTERSECTIONS_ONLY']

    point_barriers                          Optional FeatureSet. Specify one or more points to act as temporary
                                            restrictions or represent additional time or distance that may be
                                            required to travel on the underlying streets. For example, a point
                                            barrier can be used to represent a fallen tree along a street or
                                            time delay spent at a railroad crossing.

                                            The tool imposes a limit of 250 points that can be added
                                            as barriers.
                                            When specifying the point barriers, you can set properties for each one, 
                                            such as its name or barrier type, by using attributes. The point barriers 
                                            can be specified with the following attributes: 

                                              * ``Name``: The name of the barrier.
                                              * ``BarrierType``: Specifies whether the point barrier restricts travel
                                                completely or adds time or distance when it is crossed. The value
                                                for this attribute is specified as one of the following
                                                integers (use the numeric code, not the name in parentheses):
                                                * 0 (Restriction) - Prohibits travel through the barrier. The barrier
                                                  is referred to as a restriction point barrier since it acts as a
                                                  restriction.

                                                * 2 (Added Cost) - Traveling through the barrier increases the travel
                                                  time or distance by the amount specified in the
                                                  Additional_Time or Additional_Distance field. This barrier type is
                                                  referred to as an added-cost point barrier.
                                              * ``Additional_Time``: Indicates how much travel time is added when the
                                                barrier is traversed. This field is applicable only for added-cost
                                                barriers and only if the measurement units are time based. This field
                                                value must be greater than or equal to zero, and its units are the same as those specified in the
                                                Measurement Units parameter.
                                              * ``Additional_Distance``: Indicates how much distance is added when the barrier is
                                                traversed. This field is applicable only for added-cost barriers
                                                and only if the measurement units are distance based. The field value
                                                must be greater than or equal to zero, and its units are the same as those specified in the
                                                Measurement Units parameter.
                                              * ``Additional_Cost``: Indicates how much cost is added when the barrier is traversed. 
                                                This field is applicable only for added-cost barriers and only if the travel mode used 
                                                for the analysis uses an impedance attribute that is neither time-based or distance-based.
                                              * ``FullEdge``: Specify how the restriction point barriers are applied to the edge elements 
                                                during the analysis. The field value is specified as one of the following integers (use the 
                                                numeric code, not the name in parentheses):

                                                * 0 (False): Permits travel on the edge up to the barrier, but not through it. This is the default value.
                                                * 1 (True): Restricts travel anywhere on the associated edge.
                                              * ``CurbApproach``: Specifies the direction of traffic that is affected by the barrier. 
                                                The field value is specified as one of the following integers (use the numeric code, 
                                                not the name in parentheses):

                                                  * 0 (Either side of vehicle): The barrier affects travel over the edge in both directions.
                                                  * 1 (Right side of vehicle): Vehicles are only affected if the barrier is on their right 
                                                    side during the approach. Vehicles that traverse the same edge but approach the barrier 
                                                    on their left side are not affected by the barrier.
                                                  * 2 (Left side of vehicle): Vehicles are only affected if the barrier is on their left side 
                                                    during the approach. Vehicles that traverse the same edge but approach the barrier on their 
                                                    right side are not affected by the barrier.
                                                Since junctions are points and don't have a side, barriers on junctions affect all vehicles 
                                                regardless of the curb approach.

                                                The ``CurbApproach`` property was designed to work with both kinds of national driving standards: 
                                                right-hand traffic (United States) and left-hand traffic (United Kingdom). First, consider a 
                                                facility on the left side of a vehicle. It is always on the left side regardless of whether 
                                                the vehicle travels on the left or right half of the road. What may change with national driving 
                                                standards is your decision to approach a facility from one of two directions, that is, so it 
                                                ends up on the right or left side of the vehicle. For example, if you want to arrive at a facility 
                                                and not have a lane of traffic between the vehicle and the facility, you would choose Right side of 
                                                vehicle (1) in the United States but Left side of vehicle (2) in the United Kingdom.
                                              * ``Bearing``: The direction in which a point is moving. The units are degrees and are measured clockwise 
                                                from true north. This field is used in conjunction with the BearingTol field.

                                                Bearing data is usually sent automatically from a mobile device equipped with a GPS receiver. 
                                                Try to include bearing data if you are loading an input location that is moving, such as a pedestrian or a vehicle.

                                                Using this field tends to prevent adding locations to the wrong edges, which can occur when a vehicle 
                                                is near an intersection or an overpass for example. Bearing also helps the tool determine on which side 
                                                of the street the point is.
                                              * ``BearingTol``: The bearing tolerance value creates a range of acceptable bearing values when locating moving 
                                                points on an edge using the Bearing field. If the value from the Bearing field is within the range of acceptable 
                                                values that are generated from the bearing tolerance on an edge, the point can be added as a network location 
                                                there; otherwise, the closest point on the next-nearest edge is evaluated.

                                                The units are in degrees, and the default value is 30. Values must be greater than 0 and less than 180. 
                                                A value of 30 means that when ArcGIS Network Analyst extension attempts to add a network location on an edge, 
                                                a range of acceptable bearing values is generated 15 degrees to either side of the edge (left and right) and 
                                                in both digitized directions of the edge.
                                              * ``NavLatency``: This field is only used in the solve process if Bearing and BearingTol also have values; 
                                                however, entering a ``NavLatency`` value is optional, even when values are present in Bearing and BearingTol. 
                                                ``NavLatency`` indicates how much time is expected to elapse from the moment GPS information is sent from a 
                                                moving vehicle to a server and the moment the processed route is received by the vehicle's navigation device.

                                                The time units of ``NavLatency`` are the same as the units specified by the timeUnits property of the analysis object.

    line_barriers                           Optional FeatureSet.  Specify one or more lines that prohibit travel anywhere
                                            the lines intersect the streets. For example, a parade or protest
                                            that blocks traffic across several street segments can be modeled
                                            with a line barrier. A line barrier can also quickly fence off
                                            several roads from being traversed, thereby channeling possible
                                            routes away from undesirable parts of the street
                                            network.

                                            The tool imposes a limit on the number of streets you can
                                            restrict using the Line Barriers parameter. While there is no limit on
                                            the number of lines you can specify as line barriers, the combined
                                            number of streets intersected by all the lines cannot exceed
                                            500.
                                            When specifying the line barriers, you can set a name property for each one by using the following attribute: 
                                              * ``Name``: The name of the barrier.
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    polygon_barriers                        Optional FeatureSet. Specify polygons that either completely restrict travel or
                                            proportionately scale the time or distance required to travel on
                                            the streets intersected by the polygons.

                                            The service imposes a limit on the number of streets you
                                            can restrict using the Polygon Barriers parameter. While there is
                                            no limit on the number of polygons you can specify as the polygon
                                            barriers, the combined number of streets intersected by all the
                                            polygons should not exceed 2,000.
                                            When specifying the polygon barriers, you can set properties for each one, 
                                            such as its name or barrier type, by using attributes. 
                                            The polygon barriers can be specified with the following attributes: 
                                              * ``Name``: The name of the barrier.
                                              * ``BarrierType``: Specifies whether the barrier restricts travel completely
                                                or scales the time or distance for traveling through it. The field
                                                value is specified as one of the following integers (use the numeric code, not the name in parentheses):

                                                  * 0 (Restriction) - Prohibits traveling through any part of the barrier.
                                                    The barrier is referred to as a restriction polygon barrier since it
                                                    prohibits traveling on streets intersected by the barrier. One use
                                                    of this type of barrier is to model floods covering areas of the
                                                    street that make traveling on those streets impossible.

                                                  * 1 (Scaled Cost)-Scales the time or distance required to travel the
                                                    underlying streets by a factor specified using the ScaledTimeFactor
                                                    or ScaledDistanceFactor fields. If the streets are partially
                                                    covered by the barrier, the travel time or distance is apportioned
                                                    and then scaled. For example, a factor 0.25 would mean that travel
                                                    on underlying streets is expected to be four times faster than
                                                    normal. A factor of 3.0 would mean it is expected to take three
                                                    times longer than normal to travel on underlying streets. This
                                                    barrier type is referred to as a scaled-cost polygon barrier. It
                                                    might be used to model storms that reduce travel speeds in specific
                                                    regions.
                                              * ``ScaledTimeFactor``: This is the factor by which the travel time of the streets
                                                intersected by the barrier is multiplied. This field is applicable
                                                only for scaled-cost barriers and only if the measurement units are time
                                                based. The field value must be greater than zero.
                                              * ``ScaledDistanceFactor``: This is the factor by which the distance of the streets
                                                intersected by the barrier is multiplied. This attribute is
                                                applicable only for scaled-cost barriers and only if the measurement
                                                units are distance based. The attribute value must be greater than
                                                zero.
                                              * ``ScaledCostFactor``: This is the factor by which the cost of the streets intersected by the barrier is multiplied. 
                                                The field value must be greater than zero.

                                                This field is applicable only for scaled-cost barriers and only if the travel mode used for the analysis uses 
                                                an impedance attribute that is neither time based nor distance based.
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    use_hierarchy                           Optional boolean. Specify whether hierarchy should be used when finding the best routes.
                                            
                                            Checked (True) - Use hierarchy when finding routes. When
                                            hierarchy is used, the tool prefers higher-order streets, such as
                                            freeways, to lower-order streets, such as local roads, and can be used
                                            to simulate the driver preference of traveling on freeways instead
                                            of local roads even if that means a longer trip. This is especially
                                            true when finding routes to faraway locations, because drivers on long-distance trips tend to prefer traveling on freeways where stops, intersections, and turns can be avoided. Using hierarchy is computationally faster,
                                            especially for long-distance routes, as the tool has to select the
                                            best route from a relatively smaller subset of streets.

                                            Unchecked (False) - Do not use hierarchy when finding routes. If
                                            hierarchy is not used, the tool considers all the streets and doesn't
                                            prefer higher-order streets when finding the route. This is often
                                            used when finding short-distance routes within a city.

                                            The tool automatically reverts to using hierarchy if the
                                            straight-line distance between orders, depots, or orders and depots is
                                            greater than 50 miles, even if you have set this parameter to not use hierarchy.
                                            The value you provide for this parameter is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom, which is the default value.
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    restrictions                            Optional string. Specify which restrictions should be honored by the tool when finding the best routes.  The value you provide for this parameter 
                                            is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom, which is the default value. A restriction represents a driving
                                            preference or requirement. In most cases, restrictions cause roads
                                            to be prohibited. For instance, using an Avoid Toll Roads restriction will result in a route that will include 
                                            roads only when it is absolutely required to travel on toll roads in order to visit an incident or a facility. 
                                            Height Restriction makes it possible to route around any clearances that are lower than the height of your vehicle. 
                                            If you are carrying corrosive materials on your vehicle, using the Any Hazmat Prohibited restriction prevents hauling 
                                            the materials along roads where it is marked as illegal to do so.

                                            Below is a list of available restrictions and a short description.
                                            Some restrictions require an additional value to be
                                            specified for their desired use. This value needs to be associated
                                            with the restriction name and a specific parameter intended to work
                                            with the restriction. You can identify such restrictions if their
                                            names appear under the ``AttributeName`` column in the Attribute
                                            Parameter Values parameter. The ``ParameterValue`` field should be

                                            restriction to be correctly used when finding traversable roads.

                                            Some restrictions are supported only in certain countries; their availability is stated by region in the list below. 
                                            Of the restrictions that have limited availability within a region, you can check whether the restriction is available 
                                            in a particular country by looking at the table in the Country List section of the Data coverage for network analysis 
                                            services web page. If a country has a value of  Yes in the Logistics Attribute column, the restriction with select 
                                            availability in the region is supported in that country. If you specify restriction names that are not available in 
                                            the country where your incidents are located, the service ignores the invalid restrictions. The service also ignores 
                                            restrictions whose Restriction Usage parameter value is between 0 and 1 (see the Attribute Parameter Value parameter). 
                                            It prohibits all restrictions whose Restriction Usage parameter value is greater than 0.

                                            If you specify the Attribute Parameter Values parameter from a feature class, the field names on the feature class must match the fields as described below:
                                            
                                              * ``AttributeName``: Lists the name of the restriction.
                                              * ``ParameterName``: Lists the name of the parameter associated with the restriction. A restriction can have one or more ParameterName field
                                                values based on its intended use.
                                              * ``ParameterValue``: The value for ``ParameterName`` used by the tool when evaluating the restriction.

                                                Attribute Parameter Values is dependent on the Restrictions parameter. The ``ParameterValue`` field is applicable only
                                                if the restriction name is specified as the value for the
                                                Restrictions parameter.

                                                In Attribute Parameter Values, each restriction (listed as `AttributeName`) has a ``ParameterName`` field
                                                value, Restriction Usage, that specifies whether the restriction
                                                prohibits, avoids, or prefers travel on the roads associated with
                                                the restriction and the degree to which the roads are avoided or
                                                preferred. The Restriction Usage ``ParameterName`` can be assigned any of
                                                the following string values or their equivalent numeric values
                                                listed within the parentheses:
                                                  * ``PROHIBITED`` (-1) - Travel on the roads using the restriction is completely
                                                    prohibited.

                                                  * ``AVOID_HIGH`` (5) - It
                                                    is highly unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads
                                                    that are associated with the restriction.

                                                  * ``AVOID_MEDIUM`` (2) - It
                                                    is unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads that are
                                                    associated with the restriction.

                                                  * ``AVOID_LOW`` (1.3) - It
                                                    is somewhat unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads
                                                    that are associated with the restriction.

                                                  * ``PREFER_LOW`` (0.8) - It
                                                    is somewhat likely for the tool to include in the route the roads
                                                    that are associated with the restriction.

                                                  * ``PREFER_MEDIUM`` (0.5) - It is likely for the tool to include in the route the roads that
                                                    are associated with the restriction.

                                                  * ``PREFER_HIGH`` (0.2) - It is highly likely for the tool to include in the route the roads
                                                    that are associated with the restriction.

                                                In most cases, you can use the default value, PROHIBITED,
                                                for the Restriction Usage if the restriction is dependent on a
                                                vehicle-characteristic such as vehicle height. However, in some
                                                cases, the value for Restriction Usage depends on your routing
                                                preferences. For example, the Avoid Toll Roads restriction has the
                                                default value of AVOID_MEDIUM for the Restriction Usage parameter.
                                                This means that when the restriction is used, the tool will try to
                                                route around toll roads when it can. AVOID_MEDIUM also indicates
                                                how important it is to avoid toll roads when finding the best
                                                route; it has a medium priority. Choosing AVOID_LOW would put lower
                                                importance on avoiding tolls; choosing AVOID_HIGH instead would
                                                give it a higher importance and thus make it more acceptable for
                                                the service to generate longer routes to avoid tolls. Choosing
                                                PROHIBITED would entirely disallow travel on toll roads, making it
                                                impossible for a route to travel on any portion of a toll road.
                                                Keep in mind that avoiding or prohibiting toll roads, and thus
                                                avoiding toll payments, is the objective for some; in contrast,
                                                others prefer to drive on toll roads because avoiding traffic is
                                                more valuable to them than the money spent on tolls. In the latter
                                                case, you would choose PREFER_LOW, PREFER_MEDIUM, or PREFER_HIGH as
                                                the value for Restriction Usage. The higher the preference, the
                                                farther the tool will go out of its way to travel on the roads
                                                associated with the restriction.

    route_shape                             Optional string. Specify the type of route features that are output by the
                                            tool. The parameter can be specified using one of the following
                                            values:

                                              * True Shape - Return the exact shape of the resulting route
                                                that is based on the underlying streets.

                                              * Straight Line - Return a straight line between the
                                                incident and the facility.

                                              * None - Do not return any shapes for the routes. This value
                                                can be useful in cases where you are only interested in determining
                                                the total travel time or travel distance between the closest
                                                facility and the incident.

                                            When the Route Shape parameter is set to True Shape, the
                                            generalization of the route shape can be further controlled using
                                            the appropriate values for the Route Line Simplification Tolerance
                                            parameters.

                                            No matter which value you choose for the Route Shape
                                            parameter, the best route is always determined by minimizing the
                                            travel time or the travel distance, never using the straight-line
                                            distance between incidents and
                                            facilities. This means that only the route shapes are different,
                                            not the underlying streets that are searched when finding the
                                            route.
                                            
                                            Choice list: ['True Shape', 'Straight Line', 'None']
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    route_line_simplif ication_tolerance    Optional LinearUnit. Specify by how much you want to simplify the geometry of the output lines for 
                                            routes and directions. The value you provide for this parameter is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to 
                                            Custom, which is the default value. The tool also ignores this parameter if the ``populate_route_lines`` parameter 
                                            is unchecked (False).
                                            Simplification maintains critical
                                            points on a route, such as turns at intersections, to define the
                                            essential shape of the route and removes other points. The
                                            simplification distance you specify is the maximum allowable offset
                                            that the simplified line can deviate from the original line.
                                            Simplifying a line reduces the number of vertices that are part of
                                            the route geometry. This improves the tool execution
                                            time.
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    populate_route_edges                    Optional boolean. Specify whether the tool should generate edges for each route. Route edges represent 
                                            the individual street features or other similar features that are traversed by a route. The output Route 
                                            Edges layer is commonly used to see which streets or paths are traveled on the most or least by the resultant 
                                            routes. 
                                            
                                            Checked (True) - Generate route edges. The output Route Edges layer is populated with line features.   
                                            
                                            Unchecked (False) - Don't generate route edges. The output Route Edges layer is returned, but it is empty.
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    populate_directions                     Optional boolean. Specify whether the tool should generate driving directions for
                                            each route.
                                            Checked (True):
                                            Indicates that the directions will be generated
                                            and configured based on the values for the Directions Language,
                                            Directions Style Name, and Directions Distance Units
                                            parameters.
                                            Unchecked (False):
                                            Directions are not generated, and the tool
                                            returns an empty Directions layer.
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    directions_language                     Optional string. Specify the language that should be used when generating
                                            driving directions.
                                            This parameter is used only when the populate_directions parameter is checked, or set to True.
                                            The parameter value can be specified using one of the following two- or five-character language codes:  
                                            ar-Arabic cs-Czech  de-German el-Greek  en-English  es-Spanish et-Estonian  fr-French  he-Hebrew  it-Italian  
                                            ja-Japanese  ko-Korean  lt-Lithuanian lv-Latvian  nl-Dutch  pl-Polish
                                            pt-BR-Brazilian Portuguese pt-PT-European Portuguese
                                            ru-Russian  sv-Swedish  th-Thai tr-Turkish
                                            zh-CN-Simplified Chinese

                                            If an unsupported language code is specified, the tool
                                            returns the directions using the default language,
                                            English.
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    directions_distance_units               Optional string. Specify the units for displaying travel distance in the
                                            driving directions. This parameter is used only when the Populate
                                            Directions parameter is checked, or set to True.

                                            Choice list: ['Meters', 'Kilometers', 'Feet', 'Yards', 'Miles', 'NauticalMiles']
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    directions_style_name                   Optional string. Specify the name of the formatting style for the
                                            directions. This parameter is used only when the Populate
                                            Directions parameter is checked, or set to True. The parameter can be specified
                                            using the following values:

                                            Choice list:['NA Desktop', 'NA Navigation']

                                            ``NA Desktop``: Generates turn-by-turn directions suitable for printing.
                                            ``NA Navigation``: Generates turn-by-turn directions designed for an in-vehicle navigation device.
                                            
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    travel_mode                             Optional string. Specify the mode of transportation to model in the analysis. Travel modes are managed in ArcGIS Online and can be configured by the administrator of your
                                            organization to better reflect your organization's workflows. You need to specify the name of a travel mode supported by your organization.

                                            To get a list of supported travel mode names, run the ``GetTravelModes`` tool from the Utilities toolbox available under the same GIS Server connection
                                            you used to access the tool. The ``GetTravelModes`` tool adds a table, Supported Travel Modes, to the application. Any value in the Travel Mode Name field from the
                                            Supported Travel Modes table can be specified as input. You can also specify the value from Travel Mode Settings field as input. This speeds up the tool execution as the
                                            tool does not have to lookup the settings based on the travel mode name.

                                            The default value, Custom, allows you to configure your own travel mode using the custom travel mode parameters (UTurn at Junctions, Use Hierarchy, Restrictions, Attribute Parameter Values,  and Impedance).
                                            The default values of the custom travel mode parameters model travelling by car. You may want to choose Custom and set the custom travel mode parameters listed above to model a pedestrian with a fast walking speed
                                            or a truck with a given height, weight, and cargo of certain hazardous materials. You may choose to do this to try out different settings to get desired analysis results.
                                            Once you have identified the analysis settings, you should work with your organization's administrator and save these settings as part of new or existing travel mode so that
                                            everyone in your organization can rerun the analysis with the same settings.
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    impedance                               Optional string. Specify the impedance, which is a value that represents the effort or cost of traveling 
                                            along road segments or on other parts of the transportation network.
                                            Travel time is an impedance; a car taking one minute to travel a mile along an empty road is an example of impedance. 
                                            Travel times can vary by travel mode-a pedestrian may take more than 20 minutes to walk the same mile-so it is important to 
                                            choose the right impedance for the travel mode you are modeling. Choose from the following impedance values: Drive Time-Models 
                                            travel times for a car. These travel times are static for each road and don't fluctuate with traffic. Truck Time-Models travel 
                                            times for a truck.  These travel times are static for each road and don't fluctuate with traffic. Walk Time-Models travel 
                                            times for a pedestrian. The value you provide for this parameter is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom, which is 
                                            the default value.
                                           
                                            Choice list:['Drive Time', 'Truck Time', 'Walk Time']

                                            The default value is 'Drive Time'.

    gis                                     Optional GIS. The GIS on which this tool runs. If not specified, the active GIS is used.
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    time_zone_usage_for _time_windows       Optional string. Specifies the time zone for the input date-time fields supported by the tool. This 
                                            parameter specifies the time zone for the following fields: ``TimeWindowStart1``, ``TimeWindowEnd1``, ``TimeWindowStart2``, 
                                            ``TimeWindowEnd2``, ``InboundArriveTime``, and ``OutboundDepartTime`` on orders. ``TimeWindowStart1``, ``TimeWindowEnd1``, 
                                            ``TimeWindowStart2``, and ``TimeWindowEnd2`` on depots. ``EarliestStartTime`` and ``LatestStartTime`` on routes. 
                                            ``TimeWindowStart`` and ``TimeWindowEnd`` on breaks. 
                                            
                                            Choice list:['UTC', 'GEO_LOCAL']

                                            GEO_LOCAL: The date-time values associated with the orders 
                                            or depots are in the time zone in which the orders and depots are located. For routes, the date-time 
                                            values are based on the time zone in which the starting depot for the route is located. If a route does not have a starting depot, 
                                            all orders and depots across all the routes must be in a single time zone. For breaks, the date-time values are based on the time 
                                            zone of the routes. For example, if your depot is located in an area that follows eastern standard time and has the first time window 
                                            values (specified as TimeWindowStart1 and TimeWindowEnd1) of 8 AM and 5 PM, the time window values will be treated as 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. 
                                            eastern standard time. 
                                            
                                            UTC: The date-time values associated with the orders or depots are in the in coordinated universal time (UTC) and are not based on the time zone 
                                            in which the orders or depots are located. For example, if your depot is located in an area that follows eastern standard time and has the first 
                                            time window values (specified as TimeWindowStart1 and TimeWindowEnd1) of 8 AM and 5 PM, the time window values will be treated as 12:00 p.m. 
                                            and 9:00 p.m. eastern standard time assuming the eastern standard time is obeying the daylight saving time. Specifying the date-time values 
                                            in UTC is useful if you do not know the time zone in which the orders or depots are located or when you have orders and depots in multiple time 
                                            zones, and you want all the date-time values to start simultaneously. The UTC option is applicable only when your network dataset 
                                            defines a time zone attribute. Otherwise, all the date-time values are always treated as GEO_LOCAL.

    save_output_na_layer                    Optional bolean. Specify if the tool should save the analysis settings as a network analysis layer file. You cannot 
                                            directly work with this file even when you open the file in an ArcGIS Desktop application like ArcMap. It is meant 
                                            to be sent to Esri Technical Support to diagnose the quality of results returned from the tool.
                                            
                                            Checked (True) - Save the network analysis layer file. The file is downloaded in a temporary directory on your machine. 
                                            In ArcGIS Pro, the location of the downloaded file can be determined  by viewing the value for the Output Network Analysis 
                                            Layer parameter in the entry corresponding to the tool execution in the Geoprocessing history of your Project. In ArcMap, 
                                            the location of the file can be determined by accessing the Copy Location option in the shortcut menu on the Output Network 
                                            Analysis Layer parameter in the entry corresponding to the tool execution in the Geoprocessing Results window.   
                                            
                                            Unchecked (False)-Do not save the network analysis layer file. This is the default.
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    overrides                               Optional string.  Specify additional settings that can influence the behavior of the solver when finding solutions for the network analysis problems.
                                            The value for this parameter needs to be specified in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). For example, a valid value is of the following form {"overrideSetting1" : "value1", "overrideSetting2" : "value2"}. The override setting name is always enclosed in double quotation marks. The values can be a number, Boolean, or a string. The default value for this parameter is no
                                            value, which indicates not to override any solver
                                            settings. Overrides are advanced settings that should be
                                            used only after careful analysis of the results obtained before and
                                            after applying the settings. A list of supported override settings
                                            for each solver and their acceptable values can be obtained by
                                            contacting Esri Technical Support.
