These functions are used to identify areas that meet a number of different criteria you specify. These criteria can be based
upon attribute queries (for example, parcels that are vacant) and spatial queries (for example, within 1 kilometer of a
river). The areas that are found can be selected from existing features (such as existing land parcels) or new features
can be created where all the requirements are met.

find_existing_locations searches for existing areas in a layer that meet a series of criteria.
derive_new_locations creates new areas from locations in your study area that meet a series of criteria.
find_similar_locations finds locations most similar to one or more reference locations based on criteria you specify.
find_centroids finds and generates points from the representative center (centroid) of each input multipoint, line, or area feature.
choose_best_facilities choose the best locations for facilities by allocating locations that have demand for these
facilities in a way that satisfies a given goal.
create_viewshed creates areas that are visible based on locations you specify.
create_watersheds creates catchment areas based on locations you specify.
trace_downstream determines the flow paths in a downstream direction from the locations you specify

    The ``find_existing_locations`` method selects features in the input layer that meet a query you specify.
    A query is made up of one or more expressions. There are two types of expressions: attribute and spatial.
    An example of an attribute expression is that a parcel must be vacant, which is an attribute of the Parcels layer (where STATUS = 'VACANT').
    An example of a spatial expression is that the parcel must also be within a certain distance of a river (Parcels within a distance of 0.75 Miles from Rivers).

    **Argument**                             **Description**
    -------------------------------------    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    input_layers                             Required list of feature layers. A list of layers that will be used in the expressions parameter.
                                             Each layer in the list can be:

                                             * a feature service layer with an optional filter to select specific features, or
                                             * a feature collection

                                             See :ref:`Feature Input<FeatureInput>`.

    expressions                              Required dict. There are two types of expressions, attribute and spatial.

                                             Example attribute expression:

                                             **Note**

                                             * operator can be either ``and`` or ``or``
                                             * layer is the index of the layer in the ``input_layers`` parameter.
                                             * The where clause must be surrounded by double quotes.
                                             * When dealing with text fields, values must be single-quoted ('VACANT').
                                             * Date fields support all queries except LIKE. Dates are strings in YYYY:MM:DD hh:mm:ss format.

                                             sets of features from the same layer. One way to think of grouping is that without grouping, you would have to execute

    The ``derive_new_locations`` method derives new features from the input layers that meet a query you specify. A query is
    made up of one or more expressions. There are two types of expressions: attribute and spatial. An example of an
    attribute expression is that a parcel must be vacant, which is an attribute of the Parcels layer
    (STATUS = 'VACANT'). An example of a spatial expression is that the parcel must also be within a certain
    distance of a river (Parcels within a distance of 0.75 Miles from Rivers).

    The ``derive_new_locations`` method is very similar to the ``find_existing_locations`` method, the main difference is that
    the result of ``derive_new_locations`` can contain partial features.

    * In both methods, the attribute expression  ``where`` and the spatial relationships within and contains return the same result.
      This is because these relationships return entire features.
    * When ``intersects`` or ``within_distance`` is used, ``derive_new_locations`` creates new features
      in the result. For example, when intersecting a parcel feature and a flood zone area that partially overlap each other,
      ``find_existing_locations`` will return the entire parcel whereas ``derive_new_locations`` will return just the portion of
      the parcel that is within the flood zone.

    input_layers                             Required list of feature layers. A list of layers that will be used in the expressions parameter.
                                             Each layer in the list can be:

                                             * a feature service layer with an optional filter to select specific features, or
                                             * a feature collection
    -------------------------------------    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    expressions                              Required dict. There are two types of expressions, attribute and spatial.

                                             Example attribute expression:

                                             {
                                                "operator": "and",
                                                "layer": 0,

                                             **Note**
                                             * operator can be either ``and`` or ``or``
                                             * layer is the index of the layer in the ``input_layers`` parameter.
                                             * The where clause must be surrounded by double quotes.
                                             * When dealing with text fields, values must be single-quoted ('VACANT').
                                             * Date fields support all queries except LIKE. Dates are strings in YYYY:MM:DD hh:mm:ss format. Here's an example using the date field ObsDate:
                                               "where": "ObsDate >= '1998-04-30 13:30:00' "

                                             }

                                             * operator can be either ``and`` or ``or``
                                             * layer is the index of the layer in ``the input_layers`` parameter. The result of the expression is features in this layer.
                                             * spatialRel is the spatial relationship. There are nine spatial relationships.
                                             * distance is the distance to use for the withinDistance and notWithinDistance spatial relationship.
                                             * units is the units for distance.

    .. image:: _static/images/find_similar_locations/find_similar_locations.png

    The ``find_similar_locations`` method measures the similarity of candidate locations to one or more reference locations.

    Based on criteria you specify, Find ``find_similar_locations`` can answer questions such as the following:

    Which of your stores are most similar to your top performers with regard to customer profiles?
    Based on characteristics of villages hardest hit by the disease, which other villages are high risk?
    To answer questions such as these, you provide the reference locations (the ``input_layer`` parameter), the candidate
    locations (the ``search_layer`` parameter), and the fields representing the criteria you want to match. For example,
    the ``input_layer`` might be a layer containing your top performing stores or the villages hardest hit by the disease.
    The ``search_layer`` contains your candidate locations to search. This might be all of your stores or all other villages.
    Finally, you supply a list of fields to use for measuring similarity. ``find_similar_locations`` will rank all of the
    candidate locations by how closely they match your reference locations across all of the fields you have selected.

    =======================  ===========================================================================================
    **Argument**             **Description**
    -----------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    input_layer              Required feature layer. The ``input_layer`` contains one or more
                             reference locations against which features in the ``search_layer``
                             will be evaluated for similarity. For example, the ``input_layer``
                             might contain your top performing stores or the villages hardest
                             hit by a disease.
                             It is not uncommon that the ``input_layer`` and ``search_layer`` are the
                             same feature service. For example, the feature service contains
                             locations of all stores, one of which is your top performing store.
                             If you want to rank the remaining stores from most to least similar
                             to your top performing store, you can provide a filter for both the
                             inputLayer and the ``search_layer``. The filter on the ``input_layer`` would
                             select the top performing store while the filter on the ``search_layer``
                             would select all stores except for the top performing store. You can
                             also use the optional ``input_query`` parameter to specify reference locations.

                             If there is more than one reference location, similarity will be based
                             on averages for the fields you specify in the ``analysis_fields`` parameter.
                             So, for example, if there are two reference locations and you are
                             interested in matching population, the task will look for candidate
                             locations in the ``search_layer`` with populations that are most like the
                             average population for both reference locations. If the values for the
                             reference locations are 100 and 102, for example, the method will look
                             for candidate locations with populations near 101. Consequently, you
                             will want to use fields for the reference locations fields that have
                             similar values. If, for example, the population values for one reference
                             location is 100 and the other is 100,000, the tool will look for candidate
                             locations with population values near the average of those two values: 50,050.
                             Notice that this averaged value is nothing like the population for either
                             of the reference locations. See :ref:`Feature Input<FeatureInput>`.
    -----------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    search_layer             Required feature layer. The layer containing candidate locations that
                             will be evaluated against the reference locations. See :ref:`Feature Input<FeatureInput>`.
    -----------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    analysis_fields          Required list of strings. A list of fields whose values are used to determine similarity.
                             They must be numeric fields and the fields must exist on both the ``input_layer`` and
                             the ``search_layer``. The method will find features in the ``search_layer`` that have field
                             values closest to those of the features in your ``input_layer``.
    -----------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    input_query              Optional string. In the situation where the ``input_layer`` and the ``search_layer`` are the same feature service,
                             this parameter allows you to input a query on the ``input_layer`` to specify which features are the reference locations.
                             The reference locations specified by this query will not be analyzed as candidates.
                             The syntax of ``input_query`` is the same as a filter.
    -----------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    number_of_results        Optional int. The number of ranked candidate locations output to the ``similar_result_layer``.
                             If ``number_of_results`` is not specified, or set to zero, all candidate locations will be ranked and output.
    -----------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    output_name              Optional string. If provided, the method will create a feature service of the results.
                             You define the name of the service. If ``output_name`` is not supplied, the method will return a feature collection.
    -----------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    context                  Optional string. Context contains additional settings that affect method execution.
                             For ``find_similar_locations``, there are two settings.

                             #.  Extent (``extent``) - a bounding box that defines the analysis area. Only those features
                                in the ``input_layer`` that intersect the bounding box will be analyzed.
                             #. Output Spatial Reference (``outSR``) - the output features will be projected into the output spatial reference.
    -----------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    estimate                 Optional boolean. If True, the number of credits to run the operation will be returned.
    -----------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    future                   Optional boolean. If True, the result will be a GPJob object and results will be returned asynchronously.

    The ``find_centroids`` method that finds and generates points from the representative center (centroid) of
    each input multipoint, line, or area feature. Finding the centroid of a feature is very common for many analytical
    workflows where the resulting points can then be used in other analytic workflows.

    For example, polygon features that contain demographic data can be converted to centroids that can be used in network analysis.

                                             should consider traffic conditions. To use traffic in the
                                             analysis, set travel_mode to a travel mode object whose
                                             impedance_attribute_name property is set to travel_time and
                                             assign a value to time_of_day. (A travel mode with other

                                             pical and live.
                                             Typical traffic references travel speeds that are made up of
                                             historical averages for each five-minute interval spanning a week.
                                             Live traffic retrieves speeds from a traffic feed that processes
                                             phone probe records, sensors, and other data sources to record
                                             actual travel speeds and predict speeds for the near future.

                                             Typical Traffic:

                                             To ensure the task uses typical traffic in locations where it
                                             is available, choose a time and day of the week, and then convert
                                             the day of the week to one of the following dates from 1990:

                                             * Monday - 1/1/1990
                                             * Tuesday - 1/2/1990
                                             * Wednesday - 1/3/1990
                                             * Thursday - 1/4/1990
                                             * Friday - 1/5/1990
                                             * Saturday - 1/6/1990
                                             * Sunday - 1/7/1990
                                             Set the time and date as datetime.datetime.

                                             For example, to solve for 1:03 p.m. on Thursdays, set the
                                             time and date to 1:03 p.m., 4 January 1990; and convert to
                                             datetime eg. datetime.datetime(1990, 1, 4, 1, 3).

                                             Live Traffic:

                                             To use live traffic when and where it is available,
                                             choose a time and date and convert to datetime.

                                             Esri saves live traffic data for 12 hours and references
                                             predictive data extending 12 hours into the future. If the
                                             time and date you specify for this parameter is outside the
                                             24-hour time window, or the travel time in the analysis
                                             continues past the predictive data window, the task falls
                                             back to typical traffic speeds.

                                             Examples:
                                             from datetime import datetime

If the current time is between 8:00 p.m., 21 Oct. 2014 and 8:00 p.m., 22 Oct. 2014, live traffic speeds are referenced in the analysis; otherwise, typical traffic speeds are referenced.

If the current time is between 10:20 p.m., 17 Mar. 2015 and 10:20 p.m., 18 Mar. 2015, live traffic speeds are referenced in the analysis; otherwise, typical traffic speeds are referenced.

    candidate_facilities_layer               Optional point layer. A point layer specifying one or more locations that act as facilities by providing some kind of service. Facilities specified by this parameter are not required to be part of the output solution and will be used only after all the facilities from the ``candidate_facilities_layer`` have been used when allocating demand locations.
    -------------------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    candidate_count                          Optional integer. The number of candidate facilities to choose when allocating demand locations. Note that the sum of the features in the ``required_facilities_capacity`` and the value specified for ``candidate_count`` cannot exceed 100.

                                             The default value is 1.
    -------------------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    candidate_facilities_capacity            Optional float. Specify how much demand every facility in the ``candidate_facilities_layer`` is capable of supplying.

                                             The default value is unlimited (2,147,483,647.0).
    -------------------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    candidate_facilities_capacity_field      Optional string. A field on the ``candidate_facilities_layer`` representing how much demand each facility in the ``candidate_facilities_layer`` is capable of supplying. This parameter takes precedence when ``candidate_facilities_capacity`` parameter is also specified.
    -------------------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    percent_demand_coverage                  Optional float. Specify the percentage of the total demand that you want the chosen and required facilities to capture.

                                             The default value is 100.
    -------------------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    output_name                              Optional string. If provided, the method will create a feature layer of the results. You define the name of the layer. If ``output_name`` is not supplied, the method will return a feature collection.
    -------------------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    context                                  Optional string. Additional settings such as processing extent and output spatial reference. For ``choose_best_facilities``, there are two settings.

                                             #. Extent (``extent``)-a bounding box that defines the analysis area. Only those features in the input layer that intersect the bounding box will be enriched.
                                             #. Output Spatial Reference (``outSR``)-the output features will be projected into the output spatial reference.
    -------------------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    gis                                      Optional, the GIS on which this tool runs. If not specified, the active GIS is used.
    -------------------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    estimate                                 Optional boolean. Is true, the number of credits needed to run the operation will be returned as a float.
    -------------------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    point_barrier_layer                      Optional layer. Specify one or more point features that act as temporary restrictions (in other words, barriers) when traveling on the underlying streets.

                                             A point barrier can model a fallen tree, an accident, a downed electrical line, or anything that completely blocks traffic at a specific position along
                                             the street. Travel is permitted on the street but not through the barrier. See :ref:`Feature Input<FeatureInput>`.
    -------------------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    line_barrier_layer                       Optional layer. Specify one or more line features that prohibit travel anywhere the lines intersect the streets.

                                             A line barrier prohibits travel anywhere the barrier intersects the streets. For example, a parade or protest that blocks traffic across several street
                                             segments can be modeled with a line barrier. See :ref:`Feature Input<FeatureInput>`.
    -------------------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    polygon_barrier_layer                    Optional string. Specify one or more polygon features that completely restrict travel on the streets intersected by the polygons.

                                             One use of this type of barrier is to model floods covering areas of the street network and making road travel there impossible. See :ref:`Feature Input<FeatureInput>`.
    -------------------------------------    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    future                                   Optional boolean. If True, the result will be a GPJob object and results will be returned asynchronously.

    =========================    =========================================================
    **Parameter**                **Description**
    -------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    input_layer                  Required point feature layer. The features to use as the observer locations. See :ref:`Feature Input<FeatureInput>`.
    -------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    dem_resolution               Optional string. The approximate spatial resolution (cell size) of the source elevation data used for the calculation.

                                 The resolution values are an approximation of the spatial resolution of the digital elevation model.
                                 While many elevation sources are distributed in units of arc seconds, the keyword is an approximation
                                 of those resolutions in meters for easier understanding.

                                 Choice list: ['FINEST', '10m', '24m', '30m', '90m']

                                 The default is the finest resolution available.
    -------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    maximum_distance             Optional float. This is a cutoff distance where the computation of visible areas stops. Beyond this distance, it is unknown whether the analysis points and the other objects can see each other.

                                 It is useful for modeling current weather conditions or a given time of day, such as dusk. Large values increase computation time.

                                 Unless specified, a default maximum distance will be computed based on the resolution and extent of the source DEM. The allowed maximum value is 50 kilometers.
                                 Use max_distance_units to set the units for maximum_distance.
    -------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    max_distance_units           Optional string. The units for the maximum_distance parameter.

    -------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    observer_height              Optional float. This is the height above the ground of the observer locations.

                                 The default is 1.75 meters, which is approximately the average height of a person. If you are looking from an elevated location, such as an observation tower or a tall building, use that height instead.

                                 Use observer_height_units to set the units for observer_height.

    -------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    observer_height_units        Optional string. The units for the observer_height parameter.

    -------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    target_height                Optional float. This is the height of structures or people on the ground used to
                                 establish visibility. The result viewshed are those areas where an input point can see these other objects.
                                 The converse is also true; the other objects can see an input point.

                                 * If your input points represent wind turbines and you want to determine where people standing on the
                                   ground can see the turbines, enter the average height of a person (approximately 6 feet).
                                   The result is those areas where a person standing on the ground can see the wind turbines.

                                   towers can see a smoke plume 20 feet high or higher, enter 20 feet for the height. The result
                                   is those areas where a fire lookout tower can see a smoke plume at least 20 feet high.
                                 * If your input points represent scenic overlooks along roads and trails and you want to determine
                                   where wind turbines 400 feet high or higher can be seen, enter 400 feet for the height. The result
                                   is those areas where a person standing at a scenic overlook can see a wind turbine at least 400 feet high.
                                 * If your input points represent scenic overlooks and you want to determine how much area on the ground
                                   people standing at the overlook can see, enter zero. The result is those areas that can be seen from the scenic overlook.

                                 Use target_height_units to set the units for target_height.

    -------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    target_height_units          Optional string. The units for the target_height parameter.

    -------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    generalize                   Optional boolean. Determines whether or not the viewshed polygons are to be generalized.

                                 The viewshed calculation is based on a raster elevation model that creates a result with stair-stepped edges.
                                 To create a more pleasing appearance and improve performance, the default behavior is to generalize the polygons.
                                 The generalization process smooths the boundary of the visible areas and may remove some single-cell visible areas.

                                 The default value is True.
    -------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------

    The ``create_watersheds`` method determines the watershed, or upstream contributing area, for each point
    in your analysis layer. For example, suppose you have point features representing locations
    of waterborne contamination, and you want to find the likely sources of the contamination.
    Since the source of the contamination must be somewhere within the watershed upstream of the
    point, you would use this tool to define the watersheds containing the sources of the contaminant.


    =========================    =========================================================
    **Parameter**                **Description**
    -------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    input_layer                  Required point feature layer. The point features used for calculating watersheds.
                                 These are referred to as pour points, because it is the location at which water pours out of the watershed.
                                 See :ref:`Feature Input<FeatureInput>`.
    -------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    search_distance              Optional float. The maximum distance to move the location of an input point.
                                 Use search_units to set the units for search_distance.

                                 If your input points are located away from a drainage line, the resulting watersheds
                                 are likely to be very small and not of much use in determining the upstream source of
                                 contamination. In most cases, you want your input points to snap to the nearest drainage
                                 line in order to find the watersheds that flows to a point located on the drainage line.
                                 To find the closest drainage line, specify a search distance. If you do not specify a
                                 search distance, the tool will compute and use a conservative search distance.

                                 To use the exact location of your input point, specify a search distance of zero.

                                 For analysis purposes, drainage lines have been precomputed by Esri using standard
                                 hydrologic models. If there is no drainage line within the search distance, the location
                                 containing the highest flow accumulation within the search distance is used.
    -------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    search_units                 Optional string. The linear units specified for the search distance.

                                 * 90m: The hydrologic source was built from 3 arc second - approximately 90 meter resolution, elevation data.
    -------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    generalize                   Optional boolean. Determines if the output watersheds will be smoothed into simpler shapes or conform
                                 to the cell edges of the original DEM.

                                 * True: The polygons will be smoothed into simpler shapes. This is the default.
                                 * False: The edge of the polygons will conform to the edges of the original DEM.

    The ``trace_downstream`` method determines the trace, or flow path, in a downstream direction from the points in your analysis layer.

    For example, suppose you have point features representing sources of contamination and you want to determine where in your study
    area the contamination will flow. You can use ``trace_downstream`` to identify the path the contamination will take. This trace
    can also be divided into individual line segments by specifying a distance value and units. The line being returned can be the
    total length of the flow path, a specified maximum trace length, or clipped to area features such as your study area. In many
    cases, if the total length of the trace path is returned, it will be from the source all the way to the ocean.

    =====================================    =========================================================
    **Argument**                             **Description**
    -------------------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    input_layer                              Required feature layer. The point features used for the starting location of a downstream trace.
                                             See :ref:`Feature Input<FeatureInput>`.
    -------------------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    split_distance                           Optional float. The trace line will be split into multiple lines where each line is of the specified length.
                                             The resulting trace will have multiple line segments, each with fields FromDistance and ToDistance.
    -------------------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    split_units                              Optional string. The units used to specify split distance.

                                             Choice list: ['Meters', 'Kilometers', 'Feet' 'Yards', 'Miles'].

                                             The default is 'Kilometers'.
    -------------------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    max_distance                             Optional float. Determines the total length of the line that will be returned. If you provide a
                                             ``bounding_polygon_layer`` to clip the trace, the result will be clipped to the features in ``bounding_polygon_layer``,
                                             regardless of the distance you enter here.
    -------------------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    max_distance_units                       Optional string. The units used to specify maximum distance.

                                             Choice list: ['Meters', 'Kilometers', 'Feet' 'Yards', 'Miles'].

                                             The default is 'Kilometers'.
    -------------------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    bounding_polygon_layer                   Optional feature layer. A polygon layer specifying the area(s) where you want the trace
                                             downstreams to be calculated in. For example, if you only want to calculate the trace downstream
                                             with in a county polygon, provide a layer containing the county polygon and the resulting trace
                                             lines will be clipped to the county boundary. See :ref:`Feature Input<FeatureInput>`.
    -------------------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    source_database                          Optional string. Keyword indicating the data source resolution that will be used in the analysis.

                                             Choice list: ['Finest', '30m', '90m'].

                                                * Finest: Finest resolution available at each location from all possible data sources.

                                                * 30m: The hydrologic source was built from 1 arc second - approximately 30 meter resolution, elevation data.

                                                * 90m: The hydrologic source was built from 3 arc second - approximately 90 meter resolution, elevation data.

                                             The default is 'Finest'.
    -------------------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    generalize                               Optional boolean. Determines if the output trace downstream lines will be smoothed
                                             into simpler lines or conform to the cell edges of the original DEM.
    -------------------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    output_name                              Optional string. If provided, the task will create a feature service of the results.
                                             You define the name of the service. If ``output_name`` is not supplied, the task will return a feature collection.
    -------------------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    context                                  Optional string. Context contains additional settings that affect task execution. For ``trace_downstream``, there are two settings.

                                             #.  Extent (``extent``) - a bounding box that defines the analysis area. Only those points
                                                in the ``input_layer`` that intersect the bounding box will have a downstream trace generated.
                                             #. Output Spatial Reference (``outSR``) - the output features will be projected into the output spatial reference.
    -------------------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    estimate                                 Optional boolean. If True, the number of credits to run the operation will be returned.
    -------------------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------
    future                                   Optional boolean. If True, the result will be a GPJob object and results will be returned asynchronously.
