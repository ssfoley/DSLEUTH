    direction along the geometry. It is to the right and left
    perspective of this direction that the positive and negative
    parameters will dictate where the offset is constructed. In these

    geometries will be constructed.

    Inputs:
     geometries -  The array of geometries to be offset.
     offset_distance - Specifies the distance for constructing an offset
      based on the input geometries. If the offset_distance parameter is
      positive, the constructed offset will be on the right side of the
      curve. Left-side offsets are constructed with negative values.
     offset_unit - A unit for offset distance. If a unit is not
      specified, the units are derived from spatial_ref.
     offset_how - The offset_how parameter determines how outer corners
      between segments are handled. The three options are as follows:
       esriGeometryOffsetRounded - Rounds the corner between extended
        offsets.
       esriGeometryOffsetBevelled - Squares off the corner after a
        given ratio distance.
       esriGeometryOffsetMitered - Attempts to allow extended offsets
        to naturally intersect, but if that intersection occurs too far
        from the corner, the corner is eventually bevelled off at a
        fixed distance.
     bevel_ratio - bevel_ratio is multiplied by the offset distance, and
      the result determines how far a mitered offset intersection can
      be located before it is bevelled. When mitered is specified,
      bevel_ratio is ignored and 10 is used internally. When bevelled is
      specified, 1.1 will be used if bevel_ratio is not specified.
      bevel_ratio is ignored for rounded offset.

      intersecting loops will be removed from the result offset
      geometries. The default is false.
