"""
The arcgis.raster module containing classes and raster analysis functions for working with raster data and
imagery layers.

Raster data is made up of a grid of cells, where each cell or pixel can have a value. Raster data is useful
for storing data that varies continuously, as in a satellite image, a surface of chemical concentrations, or
an elevation surface.

Use arcgis.raster.analytics.is_supported(gis) to check if raster analysis is supported in your GIS.
