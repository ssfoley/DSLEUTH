Installation
============

- Make sure you have the latest version of |py3 link| on your machine.

Note: It is highly recommended that you use a virtual environment while working with this project.  More on Python virtual environments |py3 venv link|.

- Retrieve the latest version of the :code:`visualization` directory from the :code:`annika` branch of DSLEUTH.
- In the :code:`visualization` directory, run :code:`py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.  This will install all of the necessary packages needed to run the tools.

Once the requirements have been installed, you can run the visualization tools directly from the command line.  See other pages for specific instructions.
