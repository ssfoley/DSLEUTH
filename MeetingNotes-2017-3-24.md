Action Items
============

Yuan:

 * finish baseline runs on Flux of parallel version
 * create psrc/ directory on DSLEUTH master branch
 * put parallel code into psrc/ on master branch of DSLEUTH repository, be sure to include a README with information about how the code is parallelized and how to run it with different numbers of threads
 * write README for parallel version experiments in doc/results/psrc/ describing all experiments that are contained in that directory and all planned experiments.
 * put results from previous runs in doc/results/psrc/
 * for each experiment, be sure to include a README with how the experiment was setup, the purpose of the experiment, the scenario file from the run, all of the output files, and the timing results.
 * put current version of the capstone paper in doc/
 * make sure the src/ directory has the original source and no threaded work.
 * update capstone paper with results from runs.
 
Sheng:
 * finish baseline runs on Flux of distributed framework
 * modify framework to take a configuration file with information about the executable to run, the number of scenario files to break the space into, and anything else that is currently hardcoded and needs to be controlled by the user.
 * create fwk/ directory on DSLEUTH master branch
 * put distributed framework code into fwk/ on master branch of DSLEUTH repository, be sure to include a README with information about how the code is distributed and how to run it.
 * write README for distributed framework experiments in doc/results/fwk/ describing all experiments that are contained in that directory and all planned experiments.
 * put results from previous runs in doc/results/fwk/
 * for each experiment, be sure to include a README with how the experiment was setup, the purpose of the experiment, the scenario file from the run, all of the output files, and the timing results.
 * put current version of the capstone paper in doc/
 * update capstone paper with results from runs.
 
 
Next time:
=========
 * We will discuss the results from runs on Flux.
 * We will discuss experiments to run on GRRC, and I will give you accounts on the machine.
 * We will begin the merge of the capstone document and discuss how to manage working on the shared document.
