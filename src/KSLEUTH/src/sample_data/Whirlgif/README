     you have created already.

organizations claim to have a patent covering *all* possible
implementations of the LZW-algorithm.  Such persons or organizations
are requested to complain by E-mail to dino@danbbs.dk, so that their
claim can be publicized in connection with

to comment on any such protests and to publish them in a form
which references his comments.
