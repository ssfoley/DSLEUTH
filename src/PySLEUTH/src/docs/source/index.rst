Python SLEUTH documentation
---------------------------

|  SLEUTH is an open-source cellular automata-based land use change simulation model. The purpose of the SLEUTH model is to simulate future land use and urban planning scenarios. However, the current model of SLEUTH was originally written in the language C and can only be run in environments that have a C-compiler. Because of the complexity of several components, it is difficult for new users to get started using the model. 
|  The aim of this project is to improve the portability and model's ease of use. This project improves portability by rewriting the model into a more modern language, Python. Ease of use is improved through several model enhancements, including changing the model to work with GeoTiff files and updating the documentation.
