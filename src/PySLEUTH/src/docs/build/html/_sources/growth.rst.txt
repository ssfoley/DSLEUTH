:ref:`growth_coeff` - Five coefficient, or parameter, values effect how the growth rules are applied. These values are calibrated by comparing simulated 
land cover change to a study area's historical data.

:ref:`growth_gr` - SLEUTH begins with a set of inital conditions which is the input data configuration of the landscape. A set of decision, or growth, 
rules is then applied to the data to simulate urban driven land cover change.

:ref:`growth_sm` - The coefficients do not necessarily remain static throughout an application. In response to rapid or depressed growth rates, 
the coefficients may increase or decrease to further encourage growth rate trends.
