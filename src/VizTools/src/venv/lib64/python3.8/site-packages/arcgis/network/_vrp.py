    """
    This ArcGIS Online service solves a vehicle routing problem (VRP) to find the best routes for a
    fleet of vehicles. It is similar to `solve_vehicle_routing_problem`, but `edit_vehicle_routing_problem`
    is designed to make a few, small edits to the results of a VRP and re-solve or solve a small VRP
    analysis of only two routes.

    ====================================     ====================================================================
    **Argument**                             **Description**
    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    orders                                   Required FeatureSet. Specify one or more orders (up to 2,000).
                                             These are the locations that the routes of the vehicle routing
                                             problem (VRP) analysis should visit. An order can represent a
                                             delivery (for example, furniture delivery), a pickup (such as an
                                             airport shuttle bus picking up a passenger), or some type of service
                                             or inspection (a tree trimming job or building inspection, for
                                             instance).
    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    depots                                   Required FeatureSet. These represent the location where the routes
                                             will start and end at for the routes.
    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    routes                                   Required FeatureSet. Specify one or more routes (up to 100). A route
                                             specifies vehicle and driver characteristics; after solving, it also
                                             represents the path between depots and orders.

                                             A route can have start and end depot service times, a fixed or
                                             flexible starting time, time-based operating costs, distance-based
                                             operating costs, multiple capacities, various constraints on a
                                             driver's workday, and so on. When specifying the routes, you can set
                                             properties for each one by using attributes.
    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    breaks                                   Optional FeatureSet. These are the rest periods, or breaks, for the
                                             routes in a given vehicle routing problem. A break is associated with
                                             exactly one route, and it can be taken after completing an order,
                                             while en-route to an order, or prior to servicing an order. It has a
                                             start time and a duration, for which the driver may or may not be
                                             paid.
                                             There are three options for establishing when a break begins: using
                                             a time window, a maximum travel time, or a maximum work time.
    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    time_units                               Optional String. The time units for all time-based field values in
                                             the analysis.  Allowed values: `Seconds`, `Minutes`, `Hours`, or `Days`
    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    distance_units                           Optional String. The distance units for all distance-based field
                                             values in the analysis. Allowed values: `Meters`,`Kilometers`,`Feet`,`Yards`,`Miles`,`NauticalMiles`
    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    analysis_region                          Optional String. Specify the region in which to perform the analysis.
                                             If a value is not specified for this parameter, the tool will
                                             automatically calculate the region name based on the location of the
                                             input points.
    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    default_date                             Optional Datetime. The default date for time field values that
                                             specify a time of day without including a date.
    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    uturn_policy                             Optional String. Use this parameter to restrict or permit the service
                                             area to make U-turns at junctions.

                                             The parameter can have the following values:

                                             - `ALLOW_UTURNS-U` - turns are permitted everywhere. Allowing
                                               U-turns implies that the vehicle can turn around at any junction and
                                               double back on the same street. This is the default value.

                                             - `NO_UTURNS-U` - turns are prohibited at all junctions: pseudo-junctions, intersections, and dead-ends.
                                               Note, however, that U-turns may be permitted even when this option is chosen.

                                             - `ALLOW_DEAD_ENDS_ONLY-U` - turns are prohibited at all junctions, except those that have only one connected street feature (a dead end).

                                             - `ALLOW_DEAD_ENDS_AND_INTERSECTIONS_ONLY-U` - turns are prohibited at pseudo-junctions where exactly two adjacent streets meet, but U-turns are permitted
                                               at intersections and dead ends. This prevents turning around in the middle of the road where one length of road happened to be digitized as two street features.
                                               The value you provide for this parameter is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom, which is the default value.

    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    time_window_factor                       Optional String. Rates the importance of honoring time windows.
                                             Allowed values: `High`, `Medium` or `Low`.
    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    spatially_cluster_routes                 Optional Boolean. If true, the dynamic seed points are automatically
                                             created for all routes and the orders assigned to an individual
                                             route are spatially clustered. This will reduce route intersections.
                                             When using `route_zones` set this parameter to `False`.
    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    route_zones                              Optional FeatureSet. Delineates work territories for given routes. A
                                             route zone is a polygon feature and is used to constrain routes to
                                             servicing only those orders that fall within or near the specified
                                             area.
    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    route_renewals                           Optional FeatureSet. Specifies the intermediate depots that routes can visit to
                                             reload or unload the cargo they are delivering or picking up.
    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    order_pairs                              Optional FeatureSet. This parameter pairs pickup and delivery orders
                                             so they are serviced by the same route.
    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    excess_transit_factor                    Optional String.  Rates the importance of reducing excess transit time of
                                             order pairs. Excess transit time is the amount of time exceeding the
                                             time required to travel directly between the paired orders. Excess
                                             time can be caused by driver breaks or travel to intermediate orders
                                             and depots. Allowed values: `High`, `Medium` or `Low`.
    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    point_barriers                           Optional FeatureSet. Specify points that either completely restrict travel or
                                             proportionately scale the time or distance required to travel on the streets intersected
                                             by the polygons.
    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    line_barriers                            Optional FeatureSet. Specify polylines that either completely restrict travel or
                                             proportionately scale the time or distance required to travel on the streets intersected
                                             by the polygons.
    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    polygon_barriers                         Optional FeatureSet. Specify polygons that either completely restrict travel or
                                             proportionately scale the time or distance required to travel on the streets intersected
                                             by the polygons.
    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    use_hierarchy_in_analysis                Optional Boolean. Specify whether hierarchy should be used when finding the best
                                             routes. True means use hierarchy when finding routes.
    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    restrictions                             Optional String. Specify which restrictions should be honored by the tool when finding
                                             the best routes. A restriction represents a driving preference or requirement.
    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    attribute_parameter_values               Optional Dict.  Specify additional values required by some restrictions, such as the weight
                                             of a vehicle for Weight Restriction. You can also use the attribute parameter to specify
                                             whether any restriction prohibits, avoids, or prefers travel on roads that use the
                                             restriction.
    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------

    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    route_line_simplification_tolerance      Optional Float. Specify by how much you want to simplify the geometry of the output lines
                                             for routes and directions.The value you provide for this parameter is ignored unless Travel
                                             Mode is set to Custom, which is the default value.The tool also ignores this parameter if the
                                             populate_route_lines parameter is false. Simplification maintains critical points on a route,
                                             such as turns at intersections, to define the essential shape of the route and removes other
                                             points.
    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------

    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    impedance                                Optional String. Specify the impedance, which is a value that represents the effort or cost
                                             of traveling along road segments or on other parts of the transportation network.
    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    time_zone_usage_for_time_fields          Optional String. Specifies the time zone for the input date-time fields supported by the tool. The default is GEO_LOCAL.
    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    save_output_layer                        Optional Boolean. Specify if the tool should save the analysis settings as a network analysis
                                             layer file. True means save the data and False means do not.
    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    overrides                                Optional Dict. Specify additional settings that can influence the behavior of the solver when
                                             finding solutions for the network analysis problems.
    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    save_route_data                          Optional Boolean. Choose whether the output includes a zip file that contains a file geodatabase
                                             holding the inputs and outputs of the analysis in a format that can be used to share route layers
                                             with ArcGIS Online or Portal for ArcGIS. True - Save the route data as a zip file. The
                                             file is downloaded in a temporary directory on your machine. False - Do not save the route data.
                                             This is the default.

    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    time_impedance                           Optional String. Specify the time-based impedance, which is a value that represents the travel time
                                             along road segments or on other parts of the transportation network. If the impedance for the travel
                                             mode, as specified using the impedance parameter, is time-based, the value for time_impedance and
                                             impedance parameters should be identical. Otherwise the service will return an error.
    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    distance_impedance                       Optional String. If the impedance for the travel mode, as specified using the impedance parameter, is
                                             distance-based, the value for distance_impedance and impedance parameters should be identical. Otherwise
                                             the service will return an error. Specify the distance-based impedance, which is a value that represents
                                             the travel distance along road segments or on other parts of the transportation network.
    ------------------------------------     --------------------------------------------------------------------
    populate_stop_shape                      Optional Boolean. Specify if the tool should create the shapes for the output assigned and unassigned stops.

    output_format                            Optional String. Specify the format in which the output features are created. Choose from the following formats:

                                                - Feature Set: The output features are returned as feature classes and tables. This is the default.
                                                - JSON File: The output features are returned as a compressed file containing the JSON representation of the outputs.
                                                  When this option is specified, the output is a single file (with a .zip extension) that contains one or more JSON
                                                  files (with a .json extension) for each of the outputs created by the service.
                                                - GeoJSON File: The output features are returned as a compressed file containing the GeoJSON representation of the
                                                  outputs. When this option is specified, the output is a single file (with a .zip extension) that contains one or more
                                                  GeoJSON files (with a .geojson extension) for each of the outputs created by the service.

    ``solve_vehicle_routing_problem`` tool solves a vehicle routing problem (VRP) to find the best routes for a fleet of vehicles.
    A dispatcher managing a fleet of vehicles is often required to make decisions about vehicle routing. One such decision
    involves how to best assign a group of customers to a fleet of vehicles and to sequence and schedule their visits. The
    objectives in solving such vehicle routing problems (VRP) are to provide a high level of customer service by honoring
    any time windows while keeping the overall operating and investment costs for each route as low as possible. The
    constraints are to complete the routes with available resources and within the time limits imposed by driver work
    shifts, driving speeds, and customer commitments. This method can be used to determine solutions for such complex
    fleet management tasks. 
    
    Consider an example of delivering goods to grocery stores from a central warehouse location.
    A fleet of three trucks is available at the warehouse. The warehouse operates only within a certain time window (from
    8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.) during which all trucks must return back to the warehouse. Each truck has a capacity of 15,000
    pounds, which limits the amount of goods it can carry. Each store has a demand for a specific amount of goods (
    in pounds) that needs to be delivered, and each store has time windows that confine when deliveries should be made.
    Furthermore, the driver can work only eight hours per day, requires a break for lunch, and is paid for the time spent
    on driving and servicing the stores. The goal is to come up with an itinerary for each driver (or route) such that the
    deliveries can be made while honoring all the service requirements and minimizing the total time spent on a particular
    route by the driver.

    **Argument**                            **Description**
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    orders                                  Required FeatureSet. Specify one or more orders (up to 2,000). These are the locations
                                            that the routes of the vehicle routing problem (VRP) analysis
                                            should visit. An order can represent a delivery (for example, furniture delivery), 
                                            a pickup (such as an airport shuttle bus picking up a passenger), or some type of service 
                                            or inspection (a tree trimming job or building inspection, for instance).
                                
                                            When specifying the orders, you can set properties for each one, such as its name or service time, by using
                                            attributes. The orders can be specified with the following attributes:
                                              * ``ObjectID``: The system-managed ID field.
                                              * ``Name``:  The name of the order. The name must be unique. If the name is left null, 
                                                a name is automatically generated at solve time.
                                              * ``Description``: The descriptive information about the order. This can contain any 
                                                textual information for the order and has no restrictions for uniqueness. You may want 
                                                to store a client's ID number in the Name field and the client's actual name or address 
                                                in the ``Description`` field.  
                                              * ``ServiceTime``:  This property specifies how much time will be spent at the
                                                network location when the route visits it; that is, it stores the
                                                impedance value for the network location. A zero or null value
                                                indicates the network location requires no service time.
                                                The unit for this field value is specified by the ``time_units`` parameter.
                                              * ``TimeWindowStart1``: The beginning time of the first time window for the
                                                network location. This field can contain a null value; a null value 
                                                indicates no beginning time. 
                                                
                                                A time window only states when a vehicle can 
                                                arrive at an order; it doesn't state when the service time must be
                                                completed. To account for service time and leave before the time window is over, 
                                                subtract ``ServiceTime`` from the ``TimeWindowEnd1`` field.
                                                
                                                The time window fields (``TimeWindowStart1``, ``TimeWindowEnd1``, ``TimeWindowStart2``, and ``TimeWindowEnd2``) 
                                                can contain a time-only value or a date and time value. If a time field such as ``TimeWindowStart1`` has a
                                                time-only value (for example, 8:00 AM), the date is assumed to be the date specified by the Default Date parameter. 
                                                Using date and time values (for example, 7/11/2010 8:00 AM) allows you to set time windows that span multiple days.

                                                When solving a problem that spans multiple time zones, each order's time-window values refer to the time
                                                zone in which the order is located.

                                              * ``TimeWindowEnd1``: The ending time of the first window for the network
                                                location. This field can contain a null value; a null value
                                                indicates no ending time.
                                              * ``TimeWindowStart2``: The beginning time of the second time window for the
                                                network location. This field can contain a null value; a null value
                                                indicates that there is no second time window.

                                                If the first time window is null, as specified by
                                                the ``TimeWindowStart1`` and ``TimeWindowEnd1`` fields, the second time
                                                window must also be null.

                                                If both time windows are non null, they can't
                                                overlap. Also, the second time window must occur after the
                                                first.          
                                              * ``TimeWindowEnd2``:  The ending time of the second time window for the
                                                network location. This field can contain a null
                                                value.

                                                When ``TimeWindowStart2`` and ``TimeWindowEnd2`` are both
                                                null, there is no second time window.

                                                When ``TimeWindowStart2`` is not null but ``TimeWindowEnd2``
                                                is null, there is a second time window that has a starting time but
                                                no ending time. This is valid.
                                              * ``MaxViolationTime1``: A time window is considered violated if the arrival
                                                time occurs after the time window has ended. This field specifies
                                                the maximum allowable violation time for the first time window of
                                                the order. It can contain a zero value but can't contain negative
                                                values. A zero value indicates that a time window violation at the
                                                first time window of the order is unacceptable; that is, the first
                                                time window is hard. On the other hand, a null value indicates that
                                                there is no limit on the allowable violation time. A nonzero value
                                                specifies the maximum amount of lateness; for example, a route can
                                                arrive at an order up to 30 minutes beyond the end of its first
                                                time window.

                                                The unit for this field value is specified by the Time
                                                Field Units parameter

                                                Time window violations can be tracked and weighted by the
                                                solver. Because of this, you can direct the VRP solver to take one
                                                of three approaches:

                                                  * Minimize the overall violation time, regardless of the
                                                    increase in travel cost for the fleet.

                                                  * Find a solution that balances overall violation time and
                                                    travel cost.

                                                  * Ignore the overall violation time; instead, minimize
                                                    the travel cost for the fleet.

                                                By assigning an importance level for the Time Window
                                                Violation Importance parameter, you are essentially choosing one of
                                                these three approaches. In any case, however, the solver will
                                                return an error if the value set for ``MaxViolationTime1`` is
                                                surpassed.
                                              * ``MaxViolationTime2``: The maximum allowable violation time for the second
                                                time window of the order. This field is analogous to the
                                                ``MaxViolationTime1`` field.
                                              * ``InboundArriveTime``: Defines when the item to be delivered to the order will be ready at 
                                                the starting depot. The order can be assigned to a route only if the inbound arrive time 
                                                the route's latest start time value; this way, the route cannot leave the depot before the 
                                                item is ready to be loaded onto it. 
                                                
                                                This field can help model scenarios involving inbound-wave transshipments. For example, a 
                                                job at an order requires special materials that are not currently 
                                                available at the depot. The materials are being shipped from another location and will arrive 
                                                at the depot at 11:00 a.m. To ensure a route that leaves before the shipment arrives isn't 
                                                assigned to the order, the order's inbound arrive time is set to 11:00 a.m. The special materials 
                                                arrive at 11:00 a.m., they are loaded onto the vehicle, and the vehicle departs from the depot 
                                                to visit its assigned orders.
                                              .. note::
                                              
                                                  * The route's start time, which includes service times, must occur after the inbound arrive time. 
                                                    If a route begins before an order's inbound arrive time, the order cannot be assigned to the route. 
                                                    The assignment is invalid even if the route has a start-depot service time that lasts until after the inbound arrive time.
                                                  * This time field can contain a time-only value or a date and time value. If a time-only value is 
                                                    set (for example, 11:00 AM), the date is assumed to be the date specified by the Default Date parameter.  
                                                    The default date is ignored, however, when any time field in the Depots, Routes, Orders, or Breaks includes a 
                                                    date with the time. In that case, specify all such fields with a date and time (for example, 7/11/2015 11:00 AM).
                                                  * The VRP solver honors InboundArriveTime regardless of the DeliveryQuantities value. 
                                                  * If an outbound depart time is also specified, its time value must occur after the inbound arrive time. 
                                              * ``OutboundDepartTime``: Defines when the item to be picked up at the order must arrive at the ending depot. 
                                                The order can be assigned to a route only if the route can visit the order and reach its end depot before 
                                                the specified outbound depart time. 
                                                
                                                This field can help model scenarios involving outbound-wave transshipments. 
                                                For instance, a shipping company sends out delivery trucks to pick up packages from orders and bring them into a 
                                                depot where they are forwarded on to other facilities, en route to their final destination.  
                                                At 3:00 p.m. every day, a semitrailer stops at the depot to pick up the high-priority packages and take them 
                                                directly to a central processing station. To avoid delaying the high-priority packages until the next day's 3:00 p.m. 
                                                trip, the shipping company tries to have delivery trucks pick up the high-priority packages from orders and bring them 
                                                to the depot before the 3:00 p.m. deadline. This is done by setting  the outbound depart time to 3:00 p.m.
                                              .. note::
                                              
                                                  * The route's end time, including service times, must occur before the outbound depart time. If a route reaches 
                                                    a depot but doesn't complete its end-depot service time prior to the order's outbound depart time, the order cannot 
                                                    be assigned to the route.
                                                  * This time field can contain a time-only value or a date and time value. If a time-only value is 
                                                    set (for example, 11:00 AM), the date is assumed to be the date specified by the Default Date parameter.  
                                                    The default date is ignored, however, when any time field in Depots, Routes, Orders, or Breaks includes 
                                                    a date with the time. In that case, specify all such fields with a date and time (for example, 7/11/2015 11:00 AM).
                                                  * The VRP solver honors ``OutboundDepartTime`` regardless of the ``PickupQuantities`` value. 
                                                  * If an inbound arrive time is also specified, its time value must occur before the  outbound depart time. 
                                                  
                                              * ``DeliveryQuantities``: The size of the delivery. You can specify size in any dimension you want, such as weight, 
                                                volume, or quantity. You can even specify multiple dimensions, for example, weight and volume.

                                                Enter delivery quantities without indicating units.
                                                For example, if a 300-pound object needs to be delivered to an
                                                order, enter 300. You will need to remember that the value is in
                                                pounds.

                                                If you are tracking multiple dimensions, separate
                                                the numeric values with a space. For instance, if you are recording
                                                the weight and volume of a delivery that weighs 2,000 pounds and
                                                has a volume of 100 cubic feet, enter 2000 100. Again, you need to
                                                remember the units-in this case, pounds and cubic feet. You also
                                                need to remember the sequence in which the values and their corresponding
                                                units are entered.

                                                Make sure that Capacities for Routes and
                                                ``DeliveryQuantities`` and ``PickupQuantities`` for Orders are specified in
                                                the same manner; that is, the values need to be in the same units,
                                                and if you are using multiple dimensions, the dimensions need to be
                                                listed in the same sequence for all parameters. So if you specify
                                                weight in pounds, followed by volume in cubic feet for
                                                ``DeliveryQuantities``, the capacity of your routes and the pickup
                                                quantities of your orders need to be specified the same way: weight in
                                                pounds, then volume in cubic feet. If you mix units or change the
                                                sequence, you will get unwanted results without receiving any
                                                warning messages.

                                                An empty string or null value is equivalent to all
                                                dimensions being zero. If the string has an insufficient number of
                                                values in relation to the capacity count, or dimensions being
                                                tracked, the remaining values are treated as zeros. Delivery
                                                quantities can't be negative.
                                              * ``PickupQuantities``: The size of the pickup. You can specify size in any
                                                dimension you want, such as weight, volume, or quantity. You can
                                                even specify multiple dimensions, for example, weight and volume.
                                                You cannot, however, use negative values. This field is analogous
                                                to the ``DeliveryQuantities`` field of Orders.

                                                In the case of an exchange visit, an order can have
                                                both delivery and pickup quantities.
                                              * ``Revenue``: The income generated if the order is included in a
                                                solution. This field can contain a null value-a null value
                                                indicates zero revenue-but it can't have a negative
                                                value.

                                                Revenue is included in optimizing the objective
                                                function value but is not part of the solution's operating cost;
                                                that is, the TotalCost field in the route class never includes
                                                revenue in its output. However, revenue weights the relative
                                                importance of servicing orders.
                                              * ``SpecialtyNames``: A space-separated string containing the names of the
                                                specialties required by the order. A null value indicates that the
                                                order doesn't require specialties.

                                                The spelling of any specialties listed in the Orders
                                                and Routes classes must match exactly so that the VRP solver can
                                                link them together.

                                                To illustrate what specialties are and how they
                                                work, assume a lawn care and tree trimming company has a portion of
                                                its orders that requires a bucket truck to trim tall trees. The
                                                company would enter ``BucketTruck`` in the ``SpecialtyNames`` field for
                                                these orders to indicate their special need. ``SpecialtyNames`` would
                                                be left as null for the other orders. Similarly, the company would
                                                also enter ``BucketTruck`` in the ``SpecialtyNames`` field of routes that
                                                are driven by trucks with hydraulic booms. It would leave the field
                                                null for the other routes. At solve time, the VRP solver assigns
                                                orders without special needs to any route, but it only assigns
                                                orders that need bucket trucks to routes that have
                                                them.
                                              * ``AssignmentRule``: This field specifies the rule for assigning the order to a
                                                route. It is constrained by a domain of values, which are listed
                                                below (use the numeric code, not the name in parentheses).

                                                  * 0 (Exclude) - The order is to be excluded from the
                                                    subsequent solve operation.
                                                  * 1 (Preserve route and relative sequence) - The solver must
                                                    always assign the order to the preassigned route and at the
                                                    preassigned relative sequence during the solve operation. If this
                                                    assignment rule can't be followed, it results in an order
                                                    violation. With this setting, only the relative sequence is
                                                    maintained, not the absolute sequence. To illustrate what this
                                                    means, imagine there are two orders: A and B. They have sequence
                                                    values of 2 and 3, respectively. If you set their AssignmentRule
                                                    field values to Preserve route and relative sequence, A and B's
                                                    actual sequence values may change after solving because other
                                                    orders, breaks, and depot visits could still be sequenced before,
                                                    between, or after A and B. However, B cannot be sequenced before A.
                                                  * 2 (Preserve route) - The solver must always assign the
                                                    order to the preassigned route during the solve operation. A valid
                                                    sequence must also be set even though the sequence may or may not
                                                    be preserved. If the order can't be assigned to the specified
                                                    route, it results in an order violation.
                                                  * 3 (Override) - The solver tries to preserve the route
                                                    and sequence preassignment for the order during the solve
                                                    operation. However, a new route or sequence for the order may
                                                    be assigned if it helps minimize the overall value of the objective
                                                    function. This is the default value.
                                                  * 4 (Anchor first) - The solver ignores the route and sequence preassignment (if any) 
                                                    for the order during the solve operation. It assigns a route to the order and makes 
                                                    it the first order on that route to minimize the overall value of the objective function.
                                                  * 5 (Anchor last) - The solver ignores the route and sequence preassignment (if any) for the 
                                                    order during the solve operation. It assigns a route to the order and makes it the last 
                                                    order on that route to minimize the overall value of the objective function.  
                                                    This field can't contain a null value.
                                              * ``CurbApproach``:  Specifies the direction a vehicle may arrive at and depart from the order. 
                                                The field value is specified as one of the following integers shown in the parentheses (use the 
                                                numeric code, not the name in parentheses):

                                                                           width of the road and the amount of traffic or whether the

                                                =========================  ===============================================================


                                                The ``CurbApproach`` property is designed to work with both kinds of national driving standards: 
                                                right-hand traffic (United States) and left-hand traffic (United Kingdom). First, consider an 
                                                order on the left side of a vehicle. It is always on the left side regardless of whether the 
                                                vehicle travels on the left or right half of the road. What may change with national driving 
                                                standards is your decision to approach an order from one of two directions, that is, so it ends 
                                                up on the right or left side of the vehicle. For example, if you want to arrive at an order and 
                                                not have a lane of traffic between the vehicle and the order, you would choose 1 (Right side of 
                                                vehicle) in the United States but 2 (Left side of vehicle) in the United Kingdom. 
                                              
                                              * ``RouteName``: The name of the route to which the order is assigned. As an input field, this field is used to preassign
                                                an order to a specific route. (A maximum of 200 orders can be preassigned to one route name.) It can contain a null value,
                                                indicating that the order is not preassigned to any route, and the solver determines the best possible route assignment for the order.
                                                If this is set to null, the sequence field must also be set to null.

                                                After a solve operation, if the order is routed, the ``RouteName`` field contains the name of the route to which the order is
                                                assigned.
                                              * ``Sequence``: This indicates the sequence of the order on its assigned route.

                                                As an input field, this field is used to specify the
                                                relative sequence for an order on the route. This field can contain
                                                a null value specifying that the order can be placed anywhere along
                                                the route. A null value can only occur together with a null
                                                ``RouteName`` value.

                                                The input sequence values are positive and unique
                                                for each route (shared across renewal depot visits, orders, and
                                                breaks) but do not need to start from 1 or be
                                                contiguous.

                                                After a solve operation, the Sequence field contains
                                                the sequence value of the order on its assigned route. Output
                                                sequence values for a route are shared across depot visits, orders,
                                                and breaks; start from 1 (at the starting depot); and are
                                                consecutive. So the smallest possible output sequence value for a
                                                routed order is 2, since a route always begins at a depot.
                                              * ``Bearing``: The direction in which a point is moving. The units are degrees and are measured 
                                                clockwise from true north. This field is used in conjunction with the BearingTol field.
                                                Bearing data is usually sent automatically from a mobile device equipped with a GPS receiver. 
                                                Try to include bearing data if you are loading an input location that is moving, such as a pedestrian or a vehicle.
                                                Using this field tends to prevent adding locations to the wrong edges, which can occur when a vehicle is near an 
                                                intersection or an overpass for example. Bearing also helps the tool determine on which side of the street the point is.  
                                              * ``BearingTol``: The bearing tolerance value creates a range of acceptable bearing values when 
                                                locating moving points on an edge using the Bearing field. If the value from the Bearing field is 
                                                within the range of acceptable values that are generated from the bearing tolerance on an edge, the 
                                                point can be added as a network location there; otherwise, the closest point on the next-nearest edge is evaluated.
                                          
                                                The units are in degrees, and the default value is 30. Values must be greater than 0 and less than 180. 
                                                A value of 30 means that when ArcGIS Network Analyst extension attempts to add a network location on an 
                                                edge, a range of acceptable bearing values is generated 15 degrees to either side of the edge (left and right) 
                                                and in both digitized directions of the edge.  
                                              * ``NavLatency``: This field is only used in the solve process if Bearing and BearingTol also have values; however, 
                                                entering a ``NavLatency`` value is optional, even when values are present in Bearing and ``BearingTol``. ``NavLatency`` 
                                                indicates how much time is expected to elapse from the moment GPS information is sent from a moving vehicle 
                                                to a server and the moment the processed route is received by the vehicle's navigation device.

                                                The time units of ``NavLatency`` are the same as the units specified by the ``timeUnits`` property of the analysis object.

    depots                                  Required FeatureSet. Specify one or more depots for the given vehicle routing problem. A depot is a location that 
                                            a vehicle departs from at the beginning of its workday and returns to at the end of the workday. Vehicles are 
                                            loaded (for deliveries) or unloaded (for pickups) at depots at the start of the route. In some cases, a depot can also act as a
                                            renewal location whereby the vehicle can unload or reload and continue performing deliveries and pickups. A depot has open and
                                            close times, as specified by a hard time window. Vehicles can't arrive at a depot outside of this time window.
                                            When specifying the orders, you can set properties for each one, such as its name or service time, by using attributes. 
                                            
                                            The orders can be specified with the following attributes: 

                                              * ``ObjectID``: The system-managed ID field.
                                              * ``Name``: The name of the depot. The ``StartDepotName`` and ``EndDepotName`` fields of the Routes record set reference the names you specify
                                                here. It is also referenced by the Route Renewals record set, when used.

                                                Depot names are case insensitive and have to be nonempty and unique.
                                              * ``Description`` : The descriptive information about the depot location. This can contain any textual information and has 
                                                no restrictions for uniqueness.

                                                For example, if you want to note which region a depot is in or the depot's address and telephone number, you can enter 
                                                the information here rather than in the Name field.
                                              * ``TimeWindowStart1``: The beginning time of the first time window for the network location. This field can contain a null value; 
                                                a null value indicates no beginning time.
                                              
                                                Time window fields can contain a time-only value or a date and time value. If a time field has a time-only value (for example,
                                                8:00 AM), the date is assumed to be the date specified by the Default Date parameter of the analysis layer. Using date and time
                                                values (for example, 7/11/2010 8:00 AM) allows you to set time windows that span multiple days.

                                                When solving a problem that spans multiple time zones, each depot's time-window values refer to the time zone in which the depot is located. 
                                              * ``TimeWindowEnd1``: The ending time of the first window for the network
                                                location. This field can contain a null value; a null value
                                                indicates no ending time.
                                              * ``TimeWindowStart2``: The beginning time of the second time window for the network location. 
                                                This field can contain a null value; a null value indicates that there is no second time window.

                                                If the first time window is null, as specified by the
                                                ``TimeWindowStart1`` and ``TimeWindowEnd1`` fields, the second time window
                                                must also be null.

                                                If both time windows are nonnull, they can't overlap.
                                                Also, the second time window must occur after the first.
                                              * ``TimeWindowEnd2``: The ending time of the second time window for the network
                                                location. This field can contain a null value.

                                                When ``TimeWindowStart2`` and ``TimeWindowEnd2`` are both null,
                                                there is no second time window.
                      
                                                When ``TimeWindowStart2`` is not null but ``TimeWindowEnd2`` is
                                                null, there is a second time window that has a starting time but no
                                                ending time. This is valid.
                                              * ``CurbApproach``:  Specifies the direction a vehicle may arrive at and depart
                                                from the depot. The field value is specified as one of the
                                                following integers shown in the parentheses (use the numeric code, not the name in parentheses):

                                                =========================  ===============================================================
                                              
                                                The ``CurbApproach`` property is designed to work with both kinds of national driving standards: right-hand traffic (United States) 
                                                and left-hand traffic (United Kingdom). First, consider a depot on the left side of a vehicle. It is always on the left side 
                                                regardless of whether the vehicle travels on the left or right half of the road. What may change with national driving standards 
                                                is your decision to approach a depot from one of two directions, that is, so it ends up on the right or left side of the vehicle. 
                                                For example, if you want to arrive at a depot and not have a lane of traffic between the vehicle and the depot, you would choose 
                                                1 (Right side of vehicle) in the United States but 2 (Left side of vehicle) in the United Kingdom. 
                                              
                                              * ``Bearing``: The direction in which a point is moving. The units are degrees and measured in a clockwise fashion from true north.
                                                This field is used in conjunction with the ``BearingTol`` field.

                                                Bearing data is usually sent automatically from a mobile
                                                device equipped with a GPS receiver. Try to include bearing
                                                data if you are loading an order that is moving, such as a
                                                pedestrian or a vehicle.
                          
                                                Using this field tends to prevent adding locations to the
                                                wrong edges, which can occur when a vehicle is near an intersection
                                                or an overpass, for example. Bearing also helps the tool
                                                determine on which side of the street the point is.
                                                For more information, see the Bearing and Bearing Tolerance Help topic (http://links.esri.com/bearing-and-bearing-tolerance). 
                                              * ``BearingTol``: The bearing tolerance value creates a range of acceptable
                                                bearing values when locating moving points on an edge using the
                                                Bearing field. If the value from the Bearing field is within the
                                                range of acceptable values that are generated from the bearing
                                                tolerance on an edge, the point can be added as a network location
                                                there; otherwise, the closest point on the next-nearest edge is
                                                evaluated.

                                                The units are in degrees and the default value is 30.
                                                Values must be greater than zero and less than 180.

                                                A value of 30 means that when Network Analyst attempts to
                                                add a network location on an edge, a range of acceptable bearing
                                                values is generated 15 degrees to either side of the edge (left and
                                                right) and in both digitized directions of the edge.
                                                For more information, see the Bearing and Bearing Tolerance topic in the ArcGIS help system (http://links.esri.com/bearing-and-bearing-tolerance). 
                                              * ``NavLatency``: This field is only used in the solve process if Bearing
                                                and BearingTol also have values; however, entering a ``NavLatency``
                                                value is optional, even when values are present in Bearing and
                                                BearingTol. ``NavLatency`` indicates how much time is expected to
                                                elapse from the moment GPS information is sent from a moving
                                                vehicle to a server and the moment the processed route is received
                                                by the vehicle's navigation device. The time units of ``NavLatency``
                                                are the same as the units of the cost attribute specified by the
                                                parameter Time Attribute.

    routes                                  Required FeatureSet.  Specify one or more routes (up to 100). A route specifies vehicle and driver
                                            characteristics; after solving, it also represents the path between
                                            depots and orders.

                                            A route can have start and end depot service times, a  fixed or flexible starting time, time-based operating costs,
                                            distance-based operating costs, multiple capacities, various constraints on a driver's workday, and so on. 
                                            When specifying the routes, you can set properties for each one by using attributes. 
                                            The routes can be specified with the following attributes:

                                              * ``Name``: The name of the route. The name must be unique.

                                                The tool  generates a unique name at solve time if the field value is null; therefore, entering a value is optional in
                                                most cases. However, you must enter a name if your analysis includes breaks, route renewals, route zones, or orders that are
                                                preassigned to a route because the route name is used as a foreign
                                                key in these cases. Note that route names are case insensitive.
                                              * ``StartDepotName``: The name of the starting depot for the route. This field
                                                is a foreign key to the Name field in Depots.

                                                If the ``StartDepotName`` value is null, the route will begin
                                                from the first order assigned. Omitting the start depot is useful
                                                when the vehicle's starting location is unknown or irrelevant to
                                                your problem. However, when ``StartDepotName`` is null, EndDepotName
                                                cannot also be null.

                                                If the route is making deliveries and ``StartDepotName`` is
                                                null, it is assumed the cargo is loaded on the vehicle at a virtual
                                                depot before the route begins. For a route that has no renewal
                                                visits, its delivery orders (those with nonzero DeliveryQuantities
                                                values in the Orders class) are loaded at the start depot or
                                                virtual depot. For a route that has renewal visits, only the
                                                delivery orders before the first renewal visit are loaded at the
                                                start depot or virtual depot.
                                              * ``EndDepotName``: The name of the ending depot for the route. This field is a foreign key to the Name field in the Depots class.
                                              * ``StartDepotServiceTime``: The service time at the starting depot. This can be used to model the time spent for loading the vehicle. 
                                                This field can contain a null value; a null value indicates zero service time.

                                                The unit for this field value is specified by the Time
                                                Field Units parameter.

                                                The service times at the start and end depots are fixed
                                                values (given by the ``StartDepotServiceTime`` and ``EndDepotServiceTime``
                                                field values) and do not take into account the actual load for a
                                                route. For example, the time taken to load a vehicle at the
                                                starting depot may depend on the size of the orders. As such, the
                                                depot service times could be given values corresponding to a full
                                                truckload or an average truckload, or you could make your own time
                                                estimate.
                                              * ``EndDepotServiceTime``: The service time at the ending depot. This can be used to model the time spent for unloading the vehicle. 
                                                This field can contain a null value; a null value indicates zero service time.
                          
                                                The unit for this field value is specified by the Time
                                                Field Units parameter.

                                                The service times at the start and end depots are fixed
                                                values (given by the ``StartDepotServiceTime`` and ``EndDepotServiceTime``
                                                field values) and do not take into account the actual load for a
                                                route. For example, the time taken to load a vehicle at the
                                                starting depot may depend on the size of the orders. As such, the
                                                depot service times could be given values corresponding to a full
                                                truckload or an average truckload, or you could make your own time
                                                estimate.
                                              * ``EarliestStartTime``: The earliest allowable starting time for the route. This
                                                is used by the solver in conjunction with the time window of the
                                                starting depot for determining feasible route start
                                                times.
                        
                                                This field can't contain null values and has a default
                                                time-only value of 8:00 AM; the default value is interpreted as
                                                8:00 a.m. on the date given by the Default Date
                                                parameter.

                                                When solving a problem that spans multiple time zones, the
                                                time zone for ``EarliestStartTime`` is the same as the time zone in which the starting depot is located.
                                              * ``LatestStartTime``: The latest allowable starting time for the route. This
                                                field can't contain null values and has a default time-only value
                                                of 10:00 AM; the default value is interpreted as 10:00 a.m. on the
                                                date given by the Default Date property of the analysis
                                                layer.

                                                When solving a problem that spans multiple time zones, the
                                                time zone for ``LatestStartTime`` is the same as the time zone in which the starting depot is located.
                                              * ``ArriveDepartDelay``: This field stores the amount of travel time needed to
                                                accelerate the vehicle to normal travel speeds, decelerate it to a
                                                stop, and move it off and on the network (for example, in and out
                                                of parking). By including an ``ArriveDepartDelay`` value, the VRP
                                                solver is deterred from sending many routes to service physically
                                                coincident orders.

                                                The cost for this property is incurred between visits to
                                                noncoincident orders, depots, and route renewals. For example, when
                                                a route starts from a depot and visits the first order, the total
                                                arrive/depart delay is added to the travel time. The same is true
                                                when traveling from the first order to the second order. If the
                                                second and third orders are coincident, the ``ArriveDepartDelay`` value
                                                is not added between them since the vehicle doesn't need to move.
                                                If the route travels to a route renewal, the value is added to the
                                                travel time again.

                                                Although a vehicle needs to slow down and stop for a break
                                                and accelerate afterwards, the VRP solver cannot add the
                                                ``ArriveDepartDelay`` value for breaks. This means that if a route
                                                leaves an order, stops for a break, and continues to the next
                                                order, the arrive/depart delay is added only once, not
                                                twice.

                                                To illustrate, assume there are five coincident orders in
                                                a high-rise building, and they are serviced by three different
                                                routes. This means three arrive/depart delays would be incurred;
                                                that is, three drivers would need to separately find parking places
                                                and enter the same building. However, if the orders could be
                                                serviced by just one route instead, only one driver would need to
                                                park and enter the building-only one arrive/depart delay would be
                                                incurred. Since the VRP solver tries to minimize cost, it will try
                                                to limit the arrive/depart delays and thus choose the single-route
                                                option. (Note that multiple routes may need to be sent when other
                                                constraints-such as specialties, time windows, or
                                                capacities-require it.)
                                                The unit for this field value is specified by the time_units parameter. 
                                              * ``Capacities``: The maximum capacity of the vehicle. You can specify
                                                capacity in any dimension you want, such as weight, volume, or
                                                quantity. You can even specify multiple dimensions, for example,
                                                weight and volume.

                                                Enter capacities without indicating units. For example,
                                                assume your vehicle can carry a maximum of 40,000 pounds; you would
                                                enter 40000. You need to remember for future reference that the
                                                value is in pounds.

                                                If you are tracking multiple dimensions, separate the
                                                numeric values with a space. For instance, if you are recording
                                                both weight and volume and your vehicle can carry a maximum weight
                                                of 40,000 pounds and a maximum volume of 2,000 cubic feet,
                                                Capacities should be entered as 40000 2000. Again, you need to
                                                remember the units. You also need to remember the sequence in which the
                                                values and their corresponding units are entered (pounds
                                                followed by cubic feet in this case).

                                                Remembering the units and the unit sequence is important
                                                for a couple of reasons: one, so you can reinterpret the
                                                information later; two, so you can properly enter values for the
                                                ``DeliveryQuantities`` and ``PickupQuantities`` fields for the orders. To
                                                elaborate on the second point, note that the VRP solver
                                                simultaneously refers to Capacities, ``DeliveryQuantities``, and
                                                ``PickupQuantities`` to make sure that a route doesn't become
                                                overloaded. Since units can't be entered in the field, the VRP tool can't make unit conversions, so you need to enter the
                                                values for the three fields using the same units and the same unit
                                                sequence to ensure the values are correctly interpreted. If you mix
                                                units or change the sequence in any of the three fields, you will
                                                get unwanted results without receiving any warning messages. Thus,
                                                it is a good idea to set up a unit and unit-sequence standard
                                                beforehand and continually refer to it whenever entering values for
                                                these three fields.

                                                An empty string or null value is equivalent to all values
                                                being zero. Capacity values can't be negative.

                                                If the Capacities string has an insufficient number of
                                                values in relation to the ``DeliveryQuantities`` or ``PickupQuantities``
                                                fields for orders, the remaining values are treated as
                                                zero.

                                              * ``FixedCost``: A fixed monetary cost that is incurred only if the route
                                                is used in a solution (that is, it has orders assigned to it). This
                                                field can contain null values; a null value indicates zero fixed
                                                cost. This cost is part of the total route operating
                                                cost.
                                              * ``CostPerUnitTime``: The monetary cost incurred-per unit of work time-for the
                                                total route duration, including travel times as well as service
                                                times and wait times at orders, depots, and breaks. This field
                                                can't contain a null value and has a default value of
                                                1.0.
                                                The unit for this field value is specified by the time_units parameter. 
                                              * ``CostPerUnitDistance``: The monetary cost incurred-per unit of distance
                                                traveled-for the route length (total travel distance). This field
                                                can contain null values; a null value indicates zero
                                                cost.
                                                The unit for this field value is specified by the distance_units parameter. 
                                              * ``OvertimeStartTime``: The duration of regular work time before overtime
                                                computation begins. This field can contain null values; a null
                                                value indicates that overtime does not apply.
                                                The unit for this field value is specified by the ``time_units`` parameter.
                                                For example, if the driver is to be paid overtime pay when
                                                the total route duration extends beyond eight hours,
                                                ``OvertimeStartTime`` is specified as 480 (8 hours * 60 minutes/hour),
                                                given the ``time_units`` parameter is set to Minutes.
                                              * ``CostPerUnitOvertime``: The monetary cost incurred per time unit of overtime work.
                                                This field can contain null values; a null value indicates that the
                                                ``CostPerUnitOvertime`` value is the same as the ``CostPerUnitTime``
                                                value.
                                              * ``MaxOrderCount``: The maximum allowable number of orders on the route. This
                                                field can't contain null values and has a default value of
                                                30. This value cannot exceed 200.
                                              * ``MaxTotalTime``: The maximum allowable route duration. The route duration
                                                includes travel times as well as service and wait times at orders,
                                                depots, and breaks. This field can contain null values; a null
                                                value indicates that there is no constraint on the route
                                                duration.
                                                The unit for this field value is specified by the time_units parameter. 
                                              * ``MaxTotalTravelTime``: The maximum allowable travel time for the route. The
                                                travel time includes only the time spent driving on the network and
                                                does not include service or wait times.
                          
                                                This field can contain null values; a null value indicates
                                                there is no constraint on the maximum allowable travel time. This
                                                field value can't be larger than the ``MaxTotalTime`` field
                                                value.
                                                The unit for this field value is specified by the time_units parameter. 
                                              * ``MaxTotalDistance``: The maximum allowable travel distance for the
                                                route.
                                                The unit for this field value is specified by the distance_units parameter.
                                                This field can contain null values; a null value indicates
                                                that there is no constraint on the maximum allowable travel
                                                distance.
                                              * ``SpecialtyNames``: A space-separated string containing the names of the
                                                specialties supported by the route. A null value indicates that the
                                                route does not support any specialties.
                            
                                                This field is a foreign key to the ``SpecialtyNames`` field in
                                                the orders class.
                          
                                                To illustrate what specialties are and how they work,
                                                assume a lawn care and tree trimming company has a portion of its
                                                orders that requires a bucket truck to trim tall trees. The company
                                                would enter ``BucketTruck`` in the ``SpecialtyNames`` field for these
                                                orders to indicate their special need. ``SpecialtyNames`` would be left
                                                as null for the other orders. Similarly, the company would also
                                                enter ``BucketTruck`` in the ``SpecialtyNames`` field of routes that are
                                                driven by trucks with hydraulic booms. It would leave the field
                                                null for the other routes. At solve time, the VRP solver assigns
                                                orders without special needs to any route, but it only assigns
                                                orders that need bucket trucks to routes that have them.
                                              * ``AssignmentRule``: This specifies whether the route can be used or not when
                                                solving the problem. This field is constrained by a domain of
                                                values, which are listed below (use the numeric code, not the name in parentheses).
                                                  * 1 (Include)  - The route is included in the solve operation.
                                                    This is the default value.

                                                  * 2 (Exclude) - The route is excluded from the solve
                                                    operation.

    breaks                                  Optional FeatureSet. These are the rest periods, or breaks, for the routes in a given
                                            vehicle routing problem. A break is associated with exactly one
                                            route, and it can be taken after completing an order, while en
                                            route to an order, or prior to servicing an order. It has a start
                                            time and a duration, for which the driver may or may not be paid.
                                            There are three options for establishing when a break begins: using
                                            a time window, a maximum travel time, or a maximum work
                                            time.
                                            When specifying the breaks, you can set properties for each one, such as its name or service time, by using attributes. 
                                            The breaks parameter can be specified with the following attributes:
                                              * ``RouteName``: The name of the route that the break applies to. Although
                                                a break is assigned to exactly one route, many breaks can be
                                                assigned to the same route. 

                                                This field is a foreign key to the Name field in the
                                                routes parameter, so it can't have a null value.
                                              * ``Precedence``: Precedence values sequence the breaks of a given route.
                                                Breaks with a precedence value of 1 occur before those with a value
                                                of 2, and so on.

                                                All breaks must have a precedence value, regardless of
                                                whether they are time-window, maximum-travel-time, or
                                                maximum-work-time breaks.
                                              * ``ServiceTime``: The duration of the break. This field can contain null
                                                values; a null value indicates no service time.
                                                The unit for this field value is specified by the time_units parameter. 
                                              * ``TimeWindowStart``: The starting time of the break's time window.

                                                If this field is null and ``TimeWindowEnd`` has a valid
                                                time-of-day value, the break is allowed to start any time before the
                                                ``TimeWindowEnd`` value.

                                                If this field has a value, the ``MaxTravelTimeBetweenBreaks`` and
                                                ``MaxCumulWorkTime`` field values must be null; moreover, all other breaks in the
                                                analysis layer must have null values for ``MaxTravelTimeBetweenBreaks``
                                                and ``MaxCumulWorkTime``.

                                                An error will occur at solve time if a route has multiple
                                                breaks with overlapping time windows.

                                                The time window fields in breaks can contain a time-only
                                                value or a date and time value. If a time field, such as
                                                ``TimeWindowStart``, has a time-only value (for example, 12:00 PM), the
                                                date is assumed to be the date specified by the ``default_date``
                                                parameter. Using date and time values (for example, 7/11/2012 12:00
                                                PM) allows you to specify time windows that span two or more days.
                                                This is especially beneficial when a break should be taken sometime
                                                before and after midnight.
                                                When solving a problem that spans multiple time zones, each break's time-window 
                                                values refer to the time zone in which the associated route, as specified by the ``RouteName`` field,  
                                                is located. 
                                              * ``TimeWindowEnd``: The ending time of the break's time window.

                                                If this field is null and ``TimeWindowStart`` has a valid
                                                time-of-day value, the break is allowed to start any time after the
                                                ``TimeWindowStart`` value.

                                                If this field has a value, ``MaxTravelTimeBetweenBreaks`` and
                                                ``MaxCumulWorkTime`` must be null; moreover, all other breaks in the
                                                analysis layer must have null values for ``MaxTravelTimeBetweenBreaks``
                                                and ``MaxCumulWorkTime``.
                                              * ``MaxViolationTime``: This field specifies the maximum allowable violation time
                                                for a time-window break. A time window is considered violated if
                                                the arrival time falls outside the time range.

                                                A zero value indicates the time window cannot be violated;
                                                that is, the time window is hard. A nonzero value specifies the
                                                maximum amount of lateness; for example, the break can begin up to
                                                30 minutes beyond the end of its time window, but the lateness is
                                                penalized as per the Time Window Violation Importance
                                                parameter.

                                                This property can be null; a null value with
                                                ``TimeWindowStart`` and ``TimeWindowEnd`` values indicates that there is no
                                                limit on the allowable violation time. If
                                                ``MaxTravelTimeBetweenBreaks`` or ``MaxCumulWorkTime`` has a value,
                                                ``MaxViolationTime`` must be null.
                                                The unit for this field value is specified by the time_units parameter. 
                                              * ``MaxTravelTimeBetweenBreaks``: The maximum amount of travel time that can be accumulated
                                                before the break is taken. The travel time is accumulated either
                                                from the end of the previous break or, if a break has not yet been
                                                taken, from the start of the route.

                                                If this is the route's final break,
                                                ``MaxTravelTimeBetweenBreaks`` also indicates the maximum travel time
                                                that can be accumulated from the final break to the end
                                                depot.

                                                This field is designed to limit how long a person can
                                                drive until a break is required. For instance, if the Time Field
                                                Units parameter (time_units for Python) of the analysis is set to
                                                Minutes, and ``MaxTravelTimeBetweenBreaks`` has a value of 120, the
                                                driver will get a break after two hours of driving. To assign a
                                                second break after two more hours of driving, the second break's
                                                ``MaxTravelTimeBetweenBreaks`` property should be 120.

                                                If this field has a value, ``TimeWindowStart``, ``TimeWindowEnd``,
                                                ``MaxViolationTime``, and ``MaxCumulWorkTime`` must be null for an analysis
                                                to solve successfully.
                                                The unit for this field value is specified by the time_units parameter. 
                                              * ``MaxCumulWorkTime``: The maximum amount of work time that can be accumulated
                                                before the break is taken. Work time is always accumulated from the
                                                beginning of the route.

                                                Work time is the sum of travel time and service times at
                                                orders, depots, and breaks. Note, however, that this excludes wait
                                                time, which is the time a route (or driver) spends waiting at an
                                                order or depot for a time window to begin.

                                                This field is designed to limit how long a person can work
                                                until a break is required. For instance, if the ``time_units``
                                                parameter is set to Minutes,
                                                ``MaxCumulWorkTime`` has a value of 120, and ``ServiceTime`` has a value of
                                                15, the driver will get a 15-minute break after two hours of
                                                work.

                                                Continuing with the last example, assume a second break is
                                                needed after three more hours of work. To specify this break, you
                                                would enter 315 (five hours and 15 minutes) as the second break's
                                                ``MaxCumulWorkTime`` value. This number includes the ``MaxCumulWorkTime``
                                                and ``ServiceTime`` values of the preceding break, along with the three
                                                additional hours of work time before granting the second break. To
                                                avoid taking maximum-work-time breaks prematurely, remember that
                                                they accumulate work time from the beginning of the route and that
                                                work time includes the service time at previously visited depots,
                                                orders, and breaks.

                                                If this field has a value, ``TimeWindowStart``, ``TimeWindowEnd``,
                                                ``MaxViolationTime``, and ``MaxTravelTimeBetweenBreaks`` must be null for
                                                an analysis to solve successfully.
                                                The unit for this field value is specified by the time_units parameter. 
                                              * ``IsPaid``: A Boolean value indicating whether the break is paid or
                                                unpaid. A True value indicates that the time spent at the break is
                                                included in the route cost computation and overtime determination.
                                                A False value indicates otherwise. The default value is
                                                True.
                                              * ``Sequence``: As an input field, this indicates the sequence of the
                                                break on its route. This field can contain null values. The input
                                                sequence values are positive and unique for each route (shared
                                                across renewal depot visits, orders, and breaks) but need not start
                                                from 1 or be contiguous.

                                                The solver modifies the sequence field. After solving,
                                                this field contains the sequence value of the break on its route.
                                                Output sequence values for a route are shared across depot visits,
                                                orders, and breaks; start from 1 (at the starting depot); and are
                                                consecutive. 
                                              * ``ArriveTimeUTC``: The date and time value indicating the arrival time in UTC time.
                                              * ``DepartTimeUTC``: The date and time value indicating the departure time in UTC time.

    time_units                              Optional string. The time units for all time-based field values in the
                                            analysis. Many features and records in a VRP analysis have fields
                                            for storing time values, such as ``ServiceTime`` for orders and
                                            ``CostPerUnitTime`` for routes. To minimize data entry requirements,
                                            these field values don't include units. Instead, all distance-based
                                            field values must be entered in the same units, and this parameter
                                            is used to specify the units of those values.

                                            Note that output time-based fields use the same units specified by this parameter.

    distance_units                          Optional string. The distance units for all distance-based field values in
                                            the analysis. Many features and records in a VRP analysis have
                                            fields for storing distance values, such as ``MaxTotalDistance`` and
                                            ``CostPerUnitDistance`` for Routes. To minimize data entry
                                            requirements, these field values don't include units. Instead, all
                                            distance-based field values must be entered in the same units, and
                                            this parameter is used to specify the units of those
                                            values.

                                            Note that output distance-based fields use the same units
                                            specified by this parameter.

    analysis_region                         Optional string. Specify the region in which to perform the analysis. If a value is not specified for this parameter, the tool
                                            will automatically calculate the region name based on the location
                                            of the input points. Setting the name of the region is recommended to speed up the
                                            tool execution. To specify a region, use one of

    default_date                            Optional datetime. The default date for time field values that specify a time
                                            of day without including a date. You can find these time fields in various input 
                                            parameters, such as the ServiceTime attributes in the orders and breaks parameters.

    uturn_policy                            Optional string. Use this parameter to restrict or permit the service area to make U-turns at junctions. 
                                            In order to understand the parameter values, consider for a moment the following terminology: a junction is 
                                            a point where a street segment ends and potentially connects to one or more other segments; a pseudo-junction is 
                                            a point where exactly two streets connect to one another; an intersection is a point where three or more streets 
                                            connect; and a  dead-end is where one street segment ends without connecting to another. Given this information, 
                                            the parameter can have the following values:

    time_window_factor                      Optional string. Rates the importance of honoring time windows. There are three options described below.

                                            Choice list:['High', 'Medium', 'Low']

                                              * ``High`` - Places more importance on arriving at stops on time
                                                than on minimizing drive times. Organizations that make
                                                time-critical deliveries or that are very concerned with customer
                                                service would choose High.
  
                                              * ``Medium`` - This is the default value. Balances the importance
                                                of minimizing drive times and arriving within time
                                                windows.

                                              * ``Low`` - Places more importance on minimizing drive times and
                                                less on arriving at stops on time. You may want to use this setting
                                                if you have a growing backlog of service requests. For the purpose
                                                of servicing more orders in a day and reducing the backlog, you can
                                                choose Low even though customers might be inconvenienced with your
                                                late arrivals.

                                            The default value is 'Medium'.
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    spatially_cluster_routes                Optional boolean. 
    
                                            CLUSTER (True) - Dynamic seed points are automatically created for
                                            all routes and the orders assigned to an individual
                                            route are spatially clustered. Clustering orders tends to keep
                                            routes in smaller areas and reduce how often different route lines
                                            intersect one another; yet, clustering also tends to increase
                                            overall travel times.

                                            NO_CLUSTER (False) - Dynamic seed points aren't
                                            created. Choose this option if route zones are
                                            specified.

                                            The default value is 'True'.

    route_zones                             Optional FeatureSet. Delineates work territories for given routes. A route zone
                                            is a polygon feature and is used to constrain routes to servicing
                                            only those orders that fall within or near the specified area. Here
                                            are some examples of when route zones may be useful:

                                              * Some of your employees don't have the required permits to
                                                perform work in certain states or communities. You can create a
                                                hard route zone so they only visit orders in areas where they meet
                                                the requirements.

                                              * One of your vehicles breaks down frequently so you want to
                                                minimize response time by having it only visit orders that are
                                                close to your maintenance garage. You can create a soft or hard
                                                route zone to keep the vehicle nearby.

                                            When specifying the route zones, you need to set properties for each one, such as its associated route, 
                                            by using attributes. The route zones can be specified with the following attributes: 
                                            
                                              * ``RouteName``: The name of the route to which this zone applies. A route
                                                zone can have a maximum of one associated route. This field can't
                                                contain null values, and it is a foreign key to the Name field in
                                                the feature in the routes parameter.
                                              * ``IsHardZone``: A Boolean value indicating a hard or soft route zone. A
                                                True value indicates that the route zone is hard; that is, an order
                                                that falls outside the route zone polygon can't be assigned to the
                                                route. The default value is 1 (True). A False value (0) indicates
                                                that such orders can still be assigned, but the cost of servicing
                                                the order is weighted by a function that is based on the Euclidean
                                                distance from the route zone. Basically, this means that as the
                                                straight-line distance from the soft zone to the order increases,
                                                the likelihood of the order being assigned to the route
                                                decreases.

    route_renewals                          Optional FeatureSet. Specifies the intermediate depots that routes can visit to
                                            reload or unload the cargo they are delivering or picking up.
                                            Specifically, a route renewal links a route to a depot. The
                                            relationship indicates the route can renew (reload or unload while
                                            en route) at the associated depot.

                                            Route renewals can be used to model scenarios in which a
                                            vehicle picks up a full load of deliveries at the starting depot,
                                            services the orders, returns to the depot to renew its load of
                                            deliveries, and continues servicing more orders. For example, in
                                            propane gas delivery, the vehicle may make several deliveries until
                                            its tank is nearly or completely depleted, visit a refueling point,
                                            and make more deliveries.

                                            Here are a few rules and options to consider when also
                                            working with route seed points:
                                                * The reload/unload point, or renewal location, can be
                                                  different from the start or end depot.

                                                * Each route can have one or many predetermined renewal
                                                  locations.

                                                * A renewal location may be used more than once by a single
                                                  route.

                                                * In some cases where there may be several potential renewal
                                                  locations for a route, the closest available renewal location is
                                                  chosen by the solver.
                                            When specifying the route renewals, you need to set properties for each one, such 
                                            as the name of the depot where the route renewal can occur, by using attributes. 
                                            The route renewals can be specified with the following attributes: 
                                            * ``ObjectID``: The system-managed ID field.
                                            * ``DepotName``: The name of the depot where this renewal takes place. This
                                              field can't contain a null value and is a foreign key to the Name
                                              field in the depots parameter.
                                            * ``RouteName``: The name of the route to which this renewal applies. This
                                              field can't contain a null value and is a foreign key to the Name
                                              field in the routes parameter.
                                            * ``ServiceTime``: The service time for the renewal. This field can contain a
                                              null value; a null value indicates zero service time.
                                              The unit for this field value is specified by the time_units parameter.
                                              The time taken to load a vehicle at a renewal depot may
                                              depend on the size of the vehicle and how full or empty the vehicle
                                              is. However, the service time for a route renewal is a fixed value
                                              and does not take into account the actual load. As such, the
                                              renewal service time should be given a value corresponding to a
                                              full truckload, an average truckload, or another time estimate of
                                              your choice.

    order_pairs                             Optional FeatureSet. This parameter pairs pickup and delivery orders so they are serviced by the same route.

                                            Sometimes it is required that the pickup and delivery for
                                            orders be paired. For example, a courier company might need to have
                                            a route pick up a high-priority package from one order and deliver
                                            it to another without returning to a depot, or sorting station, to
                                            minimize delivery time. These related orders can be assigned to the
                                            same route with the appropriate sequence by using order pairs.
                                            Moreover, restrictions on how long the package can stay in the
                                            vehicle can also be assigned; for example, the package might be a
                                            blood sample that has to be transported from the doctor's office to
                                            the lab within two hours.
                                            When specifying the order pairs, you need to set properties for each one, such as the names of the two orders, 
                                            by using attributes. The order pairs can be specified with the following attributes: 
                                            * ``ObjectID``: The system-managed ID field.
                                            * ``FirstOrderName``: The name of the first order of the pair. This field is a
                                              foreign key to the Name field in the orders parameter.
                                              ``SecondOrderName``: The name of the second order of the pair. This field is a
                                              foreign key to the name field in the orders parameter.

                                              The first order in the pair must be a pickup order; that
                                              is, the value for its ``DeliveryQuantities`` field is null. The second
                                              order in the pair must be a delivery order; that is, the value for
                                              its ``PickupQuantities`` field is null. The quantity picked up
                                              at the first order must agree with the quantity delivered
                                              at the second order. As a special case, both orders may have zero
                                              quantities for scenarios where capacities are not used.

                                              The order quantities are not loaded or unloaded at
                                              depots.
                                            * ``MaxTransitTime``: The maximum transit time for the pair. The transit time is
                                              the duration from the departure time of the first order to the
                                              arrival time at the second order. This constraint limits the
                                              time-on-vehicle, or ride time, between the two orders. When a
                                              vehicle is carrying people or perishable goods, the ride time is
                                              typically shorter than that of a vehicle carrying packages or
                                              nonperishable goods. This field can contain null values; a null
                                              value indicates that there is no constraint on the ride
                                              time.
                                              The unit for this field value is specified by the time_units parameter.
                                              Excess transit time (measured with respect to the direct
                                              travel time between order pairs) can be tracked and weighted by the
                                              solver. Because of this, you can direct the VRP solver to take one
                                              of three approaches:
                                                * Minimize the overall excess transit time, regardless of
                                                  the increase in travel cost for the fleet.

                                                * Find a solution that balances overall violation time and
                                                  travel cost.

                                                * Ignore the overall excess transit time and, instead,
                                                  minimize the travel cost for the fleet.

                                              By assigning an importance level for the ``excess_transit_factor`` parameter, you 
                                              are in effect choosing one of these
                                              three approaches. Regardless of the importance level, the solver
                                              will always return an error if the ``MaxTransitTime`` value is
                                              surpassed.

    excess_transit_factor                   Optional string. Rates the importance of reducing excess transit time of
                                            order pairs. Excess transit time is the amount of time exceeding
                                            the time required to travel directly between the paired orders.
                                            Excess time can be caused by driver breaks or travel to
                                            intermediate orders and depots. Listed below are the three values
                                            you can choose from.

                                            Choice list:['High', 'Medium', 'Low']

                                              * ``High`` - The solver tries to find a solution with the least
                                                excess transit time between paired orders at the expense of
                                                increasing the overall travel costs. It makes sense to use this
                                                setting if you are transporting people between paired orders and
                                                you want to shorten their ride time. This is characteristic of taxi
                                                services.
  
                                              * ``Medium`` - This is the default setting. The solver looks for
                                                a balance between reducing excess transit time and reducing the
                                                overall solution cost.

                                              * ``Low`` - The solver tries to find a solution that minimizes
                                                overall solution cost, regardless of excess transit time. This
                                                setting is commonly used with courier services. Since couriers
                                                transport packages as opposed to people, they don't need to worry
                                                about ride time. Using Low allows the couriers to service paired
                                                orders in the proper sequence and minimize the overall solution
                                                cost.
  
                                            The default value is 'Medium'.

    point_barriers                          Optional FeatureSet. Specify one or more points to act as temporary
                                            restrictions or represent additional time or distance that may be
                                            required to travel on the underlying streets. For example, a point
                                            barrier can be used to represent a fallen tree along a street or
                                            time delay spent at a railroad crossing.

                                            The tool imposes a limit of 250 points that can be added
                                            as barriers.
                                            When specifying the point barriers, you can set properties for each one, 
                                            such as its name or barrier type, by using attributes. The point barriers 
                                            can be specified with the following attributes: 

                                              * ``Name``: The name of the barrier.
                                              * ``BarrierType``: Specifies whether the point barrier restricts travel
                                              completely or adds time or distance when it is crossed. The value
                                              for this attribute is specified as one of the following
                                              integers (use the numeric code, not the name in parentheses):
                                                * 0 (Restriction) - Prohibits travel through the barrier. The barrier
                                                  is referred to as a restriction point barrier since it acts as a
                                                  restriction.

                                                * 2 (Added Cost) - Traveling through the barrier increases the travel
                                                  time or distance by the amount specified in the
                                                  Additional_Time or Additional_Distance field. This barrier type is
                                                  referred to as an added-cost point barrier.
                                              * ``Additional_Time``: Indicates how much travel time is added when the
                                                barrier is traversed. This field is applicable only for added-cost
                                                barriers and only if the measurement units are time based. This field
                                                value must be greater than or equal to zero, and its units are the same as those specified in the
                                                Measurement Units parameter.
                                              * ``Additional_Distance``: Indicates how much distance is added when the barrier is
                                                traversed. This field is applicable only for added-cost barriers
                                                and only if the measurement units are distance based. The field value
                                                must be greater than or equal to zero, and its units are the same as those specified in the
                                                Measurement Units parameter.
                                              * ``Additional_Cost``: Indicates how much cost is added when the barrier is traversed. 
                                                This field is applicable only for added-cost barriers and only if the travel mode used 
                                                for the analysis uses an impedance attribute that is neither time-based or distance-based.
                                              * ``FullEdge``: Specify how the restriction point barriers are applied to the edge elements 
                                                during the analysis. The field value is specified as one of the following integers (use the 
                                                numeric code, not the name in parentheses):

                                                * 0 (False): Permits travel on the edge up to the barrier, but not through it. This is the default value.
                                                * 1 (True): Restricts travel anywhere on the associated edge.
                                              * ``CurbApproach``: Specifies the direction of traffic that is affected by the barrier. 
                                                The field value is specified as one of the following integers (use the numeric code, 
                                                not the name in parentheses):

                                                  * 0 (Either side of vehicle): The barrier affects travel over the edge in both directions.
                                                  * 1 (Right side of vehicle): Vehicles are only affected if the barrier is on their right 
                                                    side during the approach. Vehicles that traverse the same edge but approach the barrier 
                                                    on their left side are not affected by the barrier.
                                                  * 2 (Left side of vehicle): Vehicles are only affected if the barrier is on their left side 
                                                    during the approach. Vehicles that traverse the same edge but approach the barrier on their 
                                                    right side are not affected by the barrier.
                                                Since junctions are points and don't have a side, barriers on junctions affect all vehicles 
                                                regardless of the curb approach.

                                                The ``CurbApproach`` property was designed to work with both kinds of national driving standards: 
                                                right-hand traffic (United States) and left-hand traffic (United Kingdom). First, consider a 
                                                facility on the left side of a vehicle. It is always on the left side regardless of whether 
                                                the vehicle travels on the left or right half of the road. What may change with national driving 
                                                standards is your decision to approach a facility from one of two directions, that is, so it 
                                                ends up on the right or left side of the vehicle. For example, if you want to arrive at a facility 
                                                and not have a lane of traffic between the vehicle and the facility, you would choose Right side of 
                                                vehicle (1) in the United States but Left side of vehicle (2) in the United Kingdom.
                                              * ``Bearing``: The direction in which a point is moving. The units are degrees and are measured clockwise 
                                                from true north. This field is used in conjunction with the ``BearingTol`` field.

                                                Bearing data is usually sent automatically from a mobile device equipped with a GPS receiver. 
                                                Try to include bearing data if you are loading an input location that is moving, such as a pedestrian or a vehicle.

                                                Using this field tends to prevent adding locations to the wrong edges, which can occur when a vehicle 
                                                is near an intersection or an overpass for example. Bearing also helps the tool determine on which side 
                                                of the street the point is.
                                              * ``BearingTol``: The bearing tolerance value creates a range of acceptable bearing values when locating moving 
                                                points on an edge using the Bearing field. If the value from the Bearing field is within the range of acceptable 
                                                values that are generated from the bearing tolerance on an edge, the point can be added as a network location 
                                                there; otherwise, the closest point on the next-nearest edge is evaluated.

                                                The units are in degrees, and the default value is 30. Values must be greater than 0 and less than 180. 
                                                A value of 30 means that when ArcGIS Network Analyst extension attempts to add a network location on an edge, 
                                                a range of acceptable bearing values is generated 15 degrees to either side of the edge (left and right) and 
                                                in both digitized directions of the edge.
                                              * ``NavLatency``: This field is only used in the solve process if Bearing and ``BearingTol`` also have values; 
                                                however, entering a ``NavLatency`` value is optional, even when values are present in Bearing and ``BearingTol``. 
                                                ``NavLatency`` indicates how much time is expected to elapse from the moment GPS information is sent from a 
                                                moving vehicle to a server and the moment the processed route is received by the vehicle's navigation device.

                                                The time units of ``NavLatency`` are the same as the units specified by the ``timeUnits`` property of the analysis object.

    line_barriers                           Optional FeatureSet.  Specify one or more lines that prohibit travel anywhere
                                            the lines intersect the streets. For example, a parade or protest
                                            that blocks traffic across several street segments can be modeled
                                            with a line barrier. A line barrier can also quickly fence off
                                            several roads from being traversed, thereby channeling possible
                                            routes away from undesirable parts of the street
                                            network.

                                            The tool imposes a limit on the number of streets you can
                                            restrict using the Line Barriers parameter. While there is no limit on
                                            the number of lines you can specify as line barriers, the combined
                                            number of streets intersected by all the lines cannot exceed
                                            500.
                                            When specifying the line barriers, you can set a name property for each one by using the following attribute: 
                                              * ``Name``: The name of the barrier.

    polygon_barriers                        Optional FeatureSet. Specify polygons that either completely restrict travel or
                                            proportionately scale the time or distance required to travel on
                                            the streets intersected by the polygons.

                                            The service imposes a limit on the number of streets you
                                            can restrict using the Polygon Barriers parameter. While there is
                                            no limit on the number of polygons you can specify as the polygon
                                            barriers, the combined number of streets intersected by all the
                                            polygons should not exceed 2,000.
                                            When specifying the polygon barriers, you can set properties for each one, 
                                            such as its name or barrier type, by using attributes. 
                                            The polygon barriers can be specified with the following attributes: 
                                              * ``Name``: The name of the barrier.
                                              * ``BarrierType``: Specifies whether the barrier restricts travel completely
                                                or scales the time or distance for traveling through it. The field
                                                value is specified as one of the following integers (use the numeric code, not the name in parentheses):

                                                  * 0 (Restriction) - Prohibits traveling through any part of the barrier.
                                                    The barrier is referred to as a restriction polygon barrier since it
                                                    prohibits traveling on streets intersected by the barrier. One use
                                                    of this type of barrier is to model floods covering areas of the
                                                    street that make traveling on those streets impossible.

                                                  * 1 (Scaled Cost) - Scales the time or distance required to travel the
                                                    underlying streets by a factor specified using the ``ScaledTimeFactor``
                                                    or ``ScaledDistanceFactor`` fields. If the streets are partially
                                                    covered by the barrier, the travel time or distance is apportioned
                                                    and then scaled. For example, a factor 0.25 would mean that travel
                                                    on underlying streets is expected to be four times faster than
                                                    normal. A factor of 3.0 would mean it is expected to take three
                                                    times longer than normal to travel on underlying streets. This
                                                    barrier type is referred to as a scaled-cost polygon barrier. It
                                                    might be used to model storms that reduce travel speeds in specific
                                                    regions.
                                              * ``ScaledTimeFactor``: This is the factor by which the travel time of the streets
                                                intersected by the barrier is multiplied. This field is applicable
                                                only for scaled-cost barriers and only if the measurement units are time
                                                based. The field value must be greater than zero.
                                              * ``ScaledDistanceFactor``: This is the factor by which the distance of the streets
                                                intersected by the barrier is multiplied. This attribute is
                                                applicable only for scaled-cost barriers and only if the measurement
                                                units are distance based. The attribute value must be greater than
                                                zero.
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    use_hierarchy_in_analysis               Optional boolean. Specify whether hierarchy should be used when finding the best routes.
                                            
                                            Checked (True) - Use hierarchy when finding routes. When
                                            hierarchy is used, the tool prefers higher-order streets, such as
                                            freeways, to lower-order streets, such as local roads, and can be used
                                            to simulate the driver preference of traveling on freeways instead
                                            of local roads even if that means a longer trip. This is especially
                                            true when finding routes to faraway locations, because drivers on long-distance trips tend to prefer traveling on freeways where stops, intersections, and turns can be avoided. Using hierarchy is computationally faster,
                                            especially for long-distance routes, as the tool has to select the
                                            best route from a relatively smaller subset of streets.

                                            Unchecked (False) - Do not use hierarchy when finding routes. If
                                            hierarchy is not used, the tool considers all the streets and doesn't
                                            prefer higher-order streets when finding the route. This is often
                                            used when finding short-distance routes within a city.

                                            The tool automatically reverts to using hierarchy if the
                                            straight-line distance between orders, depots, or orders and depots is
                                            greater than 50 miles, even if you have set this parameter to not use hierarchy.
                                            The value you provide for this parameter is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom, which is the default value.
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    restrictions                            Optional string. Specify which restrictions should be honored by the tool when finding the best routes.  The value you provide for this parameter 
                                            is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom, which is the default value. A restriction represents a driving
                                            preference or requirement. In most cases, restrictions cause roads
                                            to be prohibited. For instance, using an Avoid Toll Roads restriction will result in a route that will include 
                                            roads only when it is absolutely required to travel on toll roads in order to visit an incident or a facility. 
                                            Height Restriction makes it possible to route around any clearances that are lower than the height of your vehicle. 
                                            If you are carrying corrosive materials on your vehicle, using the Any Hazmat Prohibited restriction prevents hauling 
                                            the materials along roads where it is marked as illegal to do so.

                                            Below is a list of available restrictions and a short description.
                                            Some restrictions require an additional value to be
                                            specified for their desired use. This value needs to be associated
                                            with the restriction name and a specific parameter intended to work
                                            with the restriction. You can identify such restrictions if their
                                            names appear under the ``AttributeName`` column in the Attribute
                                            Parameter Values parameter. The ``ParameterValue`` field should be
                                            specified in the Attribute Parameter Values parameter for the
                                            restriction to be correctly used when finding traversable roads.

                                            Some restrictions are supported only in certain countries; their availability is stated by region in the list below. 
                                            Of the restrictions that have limited availability within a region, you can check whether the restriction is available 
                                            in a particular country by looking at the table in the Country List section of the Data coverage for network analysis 
                                            services web page. If a country has a value of  Yes in the Logistics Attribute column, the restriction with select 
                                            availability in the region is supported in that country. If you specify restriction names that are not available in 
                                            the country where your incidents are located, the service ignores the invalid restrictions. The service also ignores 
                                            restrictions whose Restriction Usage parameter value is between 0 and 1 (see the Attribute Parameter Value parameter). 
                                            It prohibits all restrictions whose Restriction Usage parameter value is greater than 0.

    attribute_parameter_values              Optional FeatureSet.  Specify additional values required by some restrictions, such as the weight of a vehicle 
                                            for Weight Restriction. You can also use the attribute parameter to specify whether any restriction prohibits, 
                                            avoids, or prefers travel on roads that use the restriction. If the restriction is
                                            meant to avoid or prefer roads, you can further specify the degree
                                            to which they are avoided or preferred using this
                                            parameter. For example, you can choose to never use toll roads, avoid them as much as possible, or even highly 
                                            prefer them.
                                            The value you provide for this parameter is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom, which is the default value.
                                            If you specify the Attribute Parameter Values parameter from a feature class, the field names on the feature class must match the fields as described below:
                                            
                                              * ``AttributeName``: Lists the name of the restriction.
                                              * ``ParameterName``: Lists the name of the parameter associated with the restriction. A restriction can have one or more ParameterName field
                                                values based on its intended use.
                                              * ``ParameterValue``: The value for ``ParameterName`` used by the tool when evaluating the restriction.

                                                Attribute Parameter Values is dependent on the Restrictions parameter. The ``ParameterValue`` field is applicable only
                                                if the restriction name is specified as the value for the
                                                Restrictions parameter.

                                                In Attribute Parameter Values, each restriction (listed as `AttributeName`) has a ``ParameterName`` field
                                                value, Restriction Usage, that specifies whether the restriction
                                                prohibits, avoids, or prefers travel on the roads associated with
                                                the restriction and the degree to which the roads are avoided or
                                                preferred. The Restriction Usage ``ParameterName`` can be assigned any of
                                                the following string values or their equivalent numeric values
                                                listed within the parentheses:
                                                  * ``PROHIBITED`` (-1) - Travel on the roads using the restriction is completely
                                                    prohibited.

                                                  * ``AVOID_HIGH`` (5) - It
                                                    is highly unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads
                                                    that are associated with the restriction.

                                                  * ``AVOID_MEDIUM`` (2) - It
                                                    is unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads that are
                                                    associated with the restriction.

                                                  * ``AVOID_LOW`` (1.3) - It
                                                    is somewhat unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads
                                                    that are associated with the restriction.

                                                  * ``PREFER_LOW`` (0.8) - It
                                                    is somewhat likely for the tool to include in the route the roads
                                                    that are associated with the restriction.

                                                  * ``PREFER_MEDIUM`` (0.5) - It is likely for the tool to include in the route the roads that
                                                    are associated with the restriction.

                                                  * ``PREFER_HIGH`` (0.2) - It is highly likely for the tool to include in the route the roads
                                                    that are associated with the restriction.

                                                In most cases, you can use the default value, PROHIBITED,
                                                for the Restriction Usage if the restriction is dependent on a
                                                vehicle-characteristic such as vehicle height. However, in some
                                                cases, the value for Restriction Usage depends on your routing
                                                preferences. For example, the Avoid Toll Roads restriction has the
                                                default value of AVOID_MEDIUM for the Restriction Usage parameter.
                                                This means that when the restriction is used, the tool will try to
                                                route around toll roads when it can. AVOID_MEDIUM also indicates
                                                how important it is to avoid toll roads when finding the best
                                                route; it has a medium priority. Choosing AVOID_LOW would put lower
                                                importance on avoiding tolls; choosing AVOID_HIGH instead would
                                                give it a higher importance and thus make it more acceptable for
                                                the service to generate longer routes to avoid tolls. Choosing
                                                PROHIBITED would entirely disallow travel on toll roads, making it
                                                impossible for a route to travel on any portion of a toll road.
                                                Keep in mind that avoiding or prohibiting toll roads, and thus
                                                avoiding toll payments, is the objective for some; in contrast,
                                                others prefer to drive on toll roads because avoiding traffic is
                                                more valuable to them than the money spent on tolls. In the latter
                                                case, you would choose PREFER_LOW, PREFER_MEDIUM, or PREFER_HIGH as
                                                the value for Restriction Usage. The higher the preference, the
                                                farther the tool will go out of its way to travel on the roads
                                                associated with the restriction.

                                            Unchecked (False) - No shape is generated for the
                                            output routes, yet the routes will still contain tabular information about the solution. 
                                            You won't be able to generate driving directions if
                                            route lines aren't created.

                                            When the Route Shape parameter is set to True Shape, the
                                            generalization of the route shape can be further controlled using
                                            the appropriate values for the Route Line Simplification Tolerance
                                            parameters.

                                            No matter which value you choose for the Route Shape
                                            parameter, the best routes are always determined by minimizing the
                                            travel along the streets, never using the straight-line
                                            distance. This means that only the route shapes are different,
                                            not the underlying streets that are searched when finding the
                                            route.
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    route_line_simplifi cation_tolerance    Optional LinearUnit. Specify by how much you want to simplify the geometry of the output lines for 
                                            routes and directions. The value you provide for this parameter is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to 
                                            Custom, which is the default value. The tool also ignores this parameter if the ``populate_route_lines`` parameter 
                                            is unchecked (False).
                                            Simplification maintains critical
                                            points on a route, such as turns at intersections, to define the
                                            essential shape of the route and removes other points. The
                                            simplification distance you specify is the maximum allowable offset
                                            that the simplified line can deviate from the original line.
                                            Simplifying a line reduces the number of vertices that are part of
                                            the route geometry. This improves the tool execution
                                            time.
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    populate_directions                     Optional boolean. Specify whether the tool should generate driving directions for
                                            each route.
                                            Checked (True):
                                            Indicates that the directions will be generated
                                            and configured based on the values for the Directions Language,
                                            Directions Style Name, and Directions Distance Units
                                            parameters.
                                            Unchecked (False):
                                            Directions are not generated, and the tool
                                            returns an empty Directions layer.
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    directions_language                     Optional string. Specify the language that should be used when generating
                                            driving directions.
                                            This parameter is used only when the populate_directions parameter is checked, or set to True.
                                            The parameter value can be specified using one of the following two- or five-character language codes:  
                                            ar-Arabic cs-Czech  de-German el-Greek  en-English  es-Spanish et-Estonian  fr-French  he-Hebrew  it-Italian  
                                            ja-Japanese  ko-Korean  lt-Lithuanian lv-Latvian  nl-Dutch  pl-Polish
                                            pt-BR-Brazilian Portuguese pt-PT-European Portuguese
                                            ru-Russian  sv-Swedish  th-Thai tr-Turkish
                                            zh-CN-Simplified Chinese

                                            If an unsupported language code is specified, the tool
                                            returns the directions using the default language,
                                            English.
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    directions_style_name                   Optional string. Specify the name of the formatting style for the
                                            directions. This parameter is used only when the Populate
                                            Directions parameter is checked, or set to True. The parameter can be specified
                                            using the following values:

                                            Choice list:['NA Desktop', 'NA Navigation']

                                            ``NA Desktop``: Generates turn-by-turn directions suitable for printing.
                                            ``NA Navigation``: Generates turn-by-turn directions designed for an in-vehicle navigation device.
                                            
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    travel_mode                             Optional string. Specify the mode of transportation to model in the analysis. Travel modes are managed in ArcGIS Online and can be configured by the administrator of your
                                            organization to better reflect your organization's workflows. You need to specify the name of a travel mode supported by your organization.

                                            To get a list of supported travel mode names, run the ``GetTravelModes`` tool from the Utilities toolbox available under the same GIS Server connection
                                            you used to access the tool. The ``GetTravelModes`` tool adds a table, Supported Travel Modes, to the application. Any value in the Travel Mode Name field from the
                                            Supported Travel Modes table can be specified as input. You can also specify the value from Travel Mode Settings field as input. This speeds up the tool execution as the
                                            tool does not have to lookup the settings based on the travel mode name.

                                            The default value, Custom, allows you to configure your own travel mode using the custom travel mode parameters (UTurn at Junctions, Use Hierarchy, Restrictions, Attribute Parameter Values,  and Impedance).
                                            The default values of the custom travel mode parameters model travelling by car. You may want to choose Custom and set the custom travel mode parameters listed above to model a pedestrian with a fast walking speed
                                            or a truck with a given height, weight, and cargo of certain hazardous materials. You may choose to do this to try out different settings to get desired analysis results.
                                            Once you have identified the analysis settings, you should work with your organization's administrator and save these settings as part of new or existing travel mode so that
                                            everyone in your organization can rerun the analysis with the same settings.
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    impedance                               Optional string. Specify the impedance, which is a value that represents the effort or cost of traveling 
                                            along road segments or on other parts of the transportation network.
                                            Travel time is an impedance; a car taking one minute to travel a mile along an empty road is an example of impedance. 
                                            Travel times can vary by travel mode-a pedestrian may take more than 20 minutes to walk the same mile-so it is important to 
                                            choose the right impedance for the travel mode you are modeling. Choose from the following impedance values: Drive Time-Models 
                                            travel times for a car. These travel times are static for each road and don't fluctuate with traffic. Truck Time-Models travel 
                                            times for a truck.  These travel times are static for each road and don't fluctuate with traffic. Walk Time-Models travel 
                                            times for a pedestrian. The value you provide for this parameter is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom, which is 
                                            the default value.
                                           
                                            Choice list:['Drive Time', 'Truck Time', 'Walk Time']

                                            The default value is 'Drive Time'.
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    gis                                     Optional GIS. The GIS on which this tool runs. If not specified, the active GIS is used.
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    time_zone_usage_ for_time_fields        Optional string. Specifies the time zone for the input date-time fields supported by the tool. This 
                                            parameter specifies the time zone for the following fields: ``TimeWindowStart1``, ``TimeWindowEnd1``, ``TimeWindowStart2``, 
                                            ``TimeWindowEnd2``, ``InboundArriveTime``, and ``OutboundDepartTime`` on orders. ``TimeWindowStart1``, ``TimeWindowEnd1``, 
                                            ``TimeWindowStart2``, and ``TimeWindowEnd2`` on depots. ``EarliestStartTime`` and ``LatestStartTime`` on routes. 
                                            ``TimeWindowStart`` and ``TimeWindowEnd`` on breaks. 
                                            
                                            Choice list:['UTC', 'GEO_LOCAL']

                                            GEO_LOCAL: The date-time values associated with the orders 
                                            or depots are in the time zone in which the orders and depots are located. For routes, the date-time 
                                            values are based on the time zone in which the starting depot for the route is located. If a route does not have a starting depot, 
                                            all orders and depots across all the routes must be in a single time zone. For breaks, the date-time values are based on the time 
                                            zone of the routes. For example, if your depot is located in an area that follows eastern standard time and has the first time window 
                                            values (specified as TimeWindowStart1 and TimeWindowEnd1) of 8 AM and 5 PM, the time window values will be treated as 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. 
                                            eastern standard time. 
                                            
                                            UTC: The date-time values associated with the orders or depots are in the in coordinated universal time (UTC) and are not based on the time zone 
                                            in which the orders or depots are located. For example, if your depot is located in an area that follows eastern standard time and has the first 
                                            time window values (specified as TimeWindowStart1 and TimeWindowEnd1) of 8 AM and 5 PM, the time window values will be treated as 12:00 p.m. 
                                            and 9:00 p.m. eastern standard time assuming the eastern standard time is obeying the daylight saving time. Specifying the date-time values 
                                            in UTC is useful if you do not know the time zone in which the orders or depots are located or when you have orders and depots in multiple time 
                                            zones, and you want all the date-time values to start simultaneously. The UTC option is applicable only when your network dataset 
                                            defines a time zone attribute. Otherwise, all the date-time values are always treated as GEO_LOCAL.              
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    save_output_layer                       Optional boolean. Specify if the tool should save the analysis settings as a network analysis layer file. 
                                            You cannot directly work with this file even when you open the file in an ArcGIS Desktop application like ArcMap. 
                                            It is meant to be sent to Esri Technical Support to diagnose the quality of results returned from the tool.
                                            True: Save the network analysis layer file. The file is downloaded in a temporary directory on your machine. In ArcGIS Pro, the location of the downloaded file can be determined by viewing the value for the Output Network Analysis Layer parameter in the entry corresponding to the tool execution in the Geoprocessing history of your Project. In ArcMap, the location of the file can be determined by accessing the Copy Location option in the shortcut menu on the Output Network Analysis Layer parameter in the entry corresponding to the tool execution in the Geoprocessing Results window.
                                            False: Do not save the network analysis layer file. This is the default.
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    overrides                               Optional string. Specify additional settings that can influence the behavior of the solver when finding solutions 
                                            for the network analysis problems. The value for this parameter needs to be specified in dict. For example, a valid value is of the following form {"overrideSetting1" : "value1", "overrideSetting2" : 
                                            "value2"}. The override setting name is always enclosed in double quotes. The values can be a number, Boolean, 
                                            or string. The default value for this parameter is no value, which indicates not to override any solver settings. Overrides 
                                            are advanced settings that should be used only after careful analysis of the results obtained before and after applying 
                                            the settings. A list of supported override settings for each solver and their acceptable values can be obtained by contacting 
                                            Esri Technical Support.
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    save_route_data                         Optional boolean. Choose whether the output includes a zip file that contains a file geodatabase holding the inputs 
                                            and outputs of the analysis in a format that can be used to share route layers with ArcGIS Online or Portal for 
                                            ArcGIS.
                                            True: Save the route data as a zip file. The file is downloaded in a temporary directory on your machine. In ArcGIS Pro, 
                                            the location of the downloaded file can be determined by viewing the value for the Output Route Data parameter in the entry 
                                            corresponding to the tool execution in the Geoprocessing history of your Project. In ArcMap, the location of the file can be 
                                            determined by accessing the Copy Location option in the shortcut menu on the Output Route Data parameter in the entry corresponding 
                                            to the tool execution in the Geoprocessing Results window.
                                            False: Do not save the route data. This is the default.  
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    time_impedance                          Optional string. Specify the time-based impedance.

    distance_impedence                      Optional string. Specify the distance-based impedance.
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    populate_stop_shapes                    Optional boolean. Specify if the tool should create the shapes for the output assigned and unassigned stops.

    output_format                           Optional. Specify the format in which the output features are created.

                                            Choose from the following formats:
                                              * Feature Set - The output features are returned as feature classes and tables. This is the default.
                                              * JSON File - The output features are returned as a compressed file containing the JSON representation of the outputs. When this option is specified, the output is a single file (with a .zip extension) that contains one or more JSON files (with a .json extension) for each of the outputs created by the service.
                                              * GeoJSON File - The output features are returned as a compressed file containing the GeoJSON representation of the outputs. When this option is specified, the output is a single file (with a .zip extension) that contains one or more GeoJSON files (with a .geojson extension) for each of the outputs created by the service.
    --------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    future                                  Optional boolean. If True, a GPJob is returned instead of results. 
                                            The GPJob can be queried on the status of the execution.
