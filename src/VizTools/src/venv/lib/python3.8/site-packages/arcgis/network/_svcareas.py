    This ``generate_service_areas`` tool determines network service areas around facilities. A network service area is a region that
    encompasses all streets that can be accessed within a given distance or travel time from one or more facilities. For instance, the
    10-minute service area for a facility includes all the streets that can be reached within 10 minutes from that facility. Service areas
    are commonly used to visualize and measure accessibility. For example, a three-minute drive-time polygon around a grocery store can
    determine which residents are able to reach the store within three minutes and are thus more likely to shop there.

                                                          generated. You can load up to 1,000 facilities. The facilities feature set has an
                                                          associated attribute table. The fields in the attribute table are listed and

                                                              whereas the service area of a hospital should be created toward the facility.

    time_of_day                                           Optional datetime. The time to depart from or arrive at the
                                                          facilities. The interpretation of this value depends on whether travel is toward or away from
                                                          the facilities.
                                                          It represents the departure time if Travel Direction is set to Away from Facility.
                                                          It represents the arrival time if Travel Direction is set to Toward Facility.

                                                          You can use the Time Zone for Time of Day parameter to specify whether this time and date
                                                          refers to UTC or the time zone in which the facility is located.

                                                          Repeatedly solving the same analysis, but using different Time of Day values, allows you to see
                                                          how a facility's reach changes over time. For instance, the five-minute service area around a
                                                          fire station may start out large in the early morning, diminish during the morning rush hour,
                                                          grow in the late morning, and so on, throughout the day.

    use_hierarchy                                         Optional boolean. Specify whether hierarchy should be used when
                                                          finding the best route between the facility and the incident.

                                                          Checked (True) - Use the hierarchy attribute for the analysis. Using a hierarchy results in the
                                                          solver preferring higher-order edges to lower-order edges. Hierarchical solves are faster, and
                                                          they can be used to simulate the preference of a driver who chooses to travel on freeways over
                                                          local roads when possible-even if that means a longer trip.

                                                          Unchecked (False) - Do not use the hierarchy attribute for the analysis. Not using a hierarchy
                                                          yields an accurate service area measured along all edges of the network dataset regardless of
                                                          hierarchy level.

                                                          Regardless of whether the Use Hierarchy parameter is checked (True), hierarchy is always used when
                                                          the largest break value exceeds 240 minutes or 240 miles (386.24 kilometers).

                                                          connects to one or more other segments; a pseudo-junction is a point where exactly two streets
                                                          connect to one another; an intersection is a point where three or more streets connect; and a

    polygon_overlap_type                                  Optional string. Specifies the option to create concentric service area

                                                              This creates polygons going between consecutive breaks. Use this option if you want to

                                                          Unchecked (False) - Creates generalized polygons, which are
                                                          generated quickly and are fairly accurate. This is the
                                                          default.

                                                          Checked (True) - Creates detailed polygons, which
                                                          accurately model the service area lines and may contain islands of
                                                          unreached areas. This option is much slower than generating
                                                          generalized polygons. This option isn't supported when using
                                                          hierarchy.
                                                          If your facilities are in an urban area with a grid-like street network,
                                                          the difference between generalized and detailed service areas would be
                                                          minimal. However, if your facilities are in a region containing mountain
                                                          and rural roads, the detailed service areas may present significantly
                                                          more accurate results than generalized service areas.

                                                          The tool supports generating detailed polygons only if the largest value specified in the Break Values
                                                          parameter is less than or equal to 15 minutes or 15 miles (24.14 kilometers).
    -------------------------------------------------     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    polygon_trim_distance                                 Optional LinearUnit. Specifies the distance within which the service area
                                                          polygons are trimmed. This is useful when finding service areas in
                                                          places that have a sparse street network and you don't want the
                                                          service area to cover large areas where there are no street
                                                          features.

                                                          The default value is 100 meters. No value or a value of 0 for this parameter
                                                          specifies that the service area polygons should not be trimmed. This
                                                          parameter value is ignored when using hierarchy.
    -------------------------------------------------     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    polygon_simplification_tolerance                      Optional LinearUnit. Specify by how much you want to
                                                          simplify the polygon geometry.

                                                          Simplification maintains critical vertices of a polygon to define its essential
                                                          shape and removes other vertices. The simplification distance you specify is the
                                                          maximum offset the simplified polygon boundaries can deviate from the original
                                                          polygon boundaries. Simplifying a polygon reduces the number of vertices and tends
                                                          to reduce drawing times.

    point_barriers                                        Optional FeatureSet. Specify one or more points to act as temporary
                                                          restrictions or represent additional time or distance that may be required to travel on the
                                                          underlying streets. For example, a point barrier can be used to represent a fallen tree along a
                                                          street or time delay spent at a railroad crossing.

                                                          The tool imposes a limit of 250 points that can be added as barriers.
                                                          When specifying the point barriers, you can set properties for each one, such as its name or
                                                          barrier type, by using attributes. The point barriers can be specified with the following
                                                          attributes:

                                                          * ``Name``: The name of the barrier.
                                                          * ``BarrierType``: Specifies whether the point barrier restricts travel
                                                            completely or adds time or distance when it is crossed. The value
                                                            for this attribute is specified as one of the following
                                                            integers (use the numeric code, not the name in parentheses):

                                                            * 0 (Restriction) - Prohibits travel through the barrier. The barrier
                                                              is referred to as a restriction point barrier since it acts as a
                                                              restriction.

                                                            * 2 (Added Cost) - Traveling through the barrier increases the travel
                                                              time or distance by the amount specified in the Additional_Time or
                                                              Additional_Distance field. This barrier type is  referred to as an
                                                              added-cost point barrier.

                                                          * ``Additional_Time``: Indicates how much travel time is added when the
                                                            barrier is traversed. This field is applicable only for added-cost
                                                            barriers and only if the Break Units value is time based. This field
                                                            value must be greater than or equal to zero, and its units are the same
                                                            as those specified in the Break Units parameter.

                                                          * ``Additional_Distance``: Indicates how much distance is added when the
                                                            barrier is traversed. This field is applicable only for added-cost barriers
                                                            and only if the Break Units value is distance based. The field value
                                                            must be greater than or equal to zero, and its units are the same as those
                                                            specified in the Break Units parameter.

    line_barriers                                         Optional FeatureSet. Specify one or more lines that prohibit travel
                                                          anywhere the lines intersect the streets. For example, a parade or protest that blocks traffic
                                                          across several street segments can be modeled with a line barrier. A line barrier can also
                                                          quickly fence off several roads from being traversed, thereby channeling possible routes away
                                                          from undesirable parts of the street network.

                                                          The tool imposes a limit on the number of streets you can
                                                          restrict using the Line Barriers parameter. While there is no limit on
                                                          the number of lines you can specify as line barriers, the combined
                                                          number of streets intersected by all the lines cannot exceed 500.

                                                          When specifying the line barriers, you can set a name property for each one by using the following
                                                          attribute:
                                                             * ``Name``: The name of the barrier.

    polygon_barriers                                      Optional FeatureSet. Specify polygons that either completely restrict travel or
                                                          proportionately scale the time or distance required to travel on
                                                          the streets intersected by the polygons.
                                                          The service imposes a limit on the number of streets you
                                                          can restrict using the Polygon Barriers parameter. While there is
                                                          no limit on the number of polygons you can specify as the polygon
                                                          barriers, the combined number of streets intersected by all the
                                                          polygons should not exceed 2,000.
                                                          When specifying the polygon barriers, you can set properties for each one, such as its name or barrier type, 
                                                          by using attributes. The polygon barriers can be specified with the following attributes: 
                                                            * ``Name``: The name of the barrier.
                                                            * ``BarrierType``: Specifies whether the barrier restricts travel completely
                                                              or scales the time or distance for traveling through it. The field
                                                              value is specified as one of the following integers (use the numeric code, not the name in parentheses):
                                                                * 0 (Restriction) - Prohibits traveling through any part of the barrier.
                                                                  The barrier is referred to as a restriction polygon barrier since it
                                                                  prohibits traveling on streets intersected by the barrier. One use
                                                                  of this type of barrier is to model floods covering areas of the

                                                                * 1 (Scaled Cost) - Scales the time or distance required to travel the
                                                                  underlying streets by a factor specified using the ScaledTimeFactor
                                                                  or ScaledDistanceFactor fields. If the streets are partially
                                                                  covered by the barrier, the travel time or distance is apportioned
                                                                  and then scaled. For example, a factor 0.25 would mean that travel
                                                                  on underlying streets is expected to be four times faster than
                                                                  normal. A factor of 3.0 would mean it is expected to take three
                                                                  times longer than normal to travel on underlying streets. This

                                                                  might be used to model storms that reduce travel speeds in specific
                                                                  regions.

                                                              intersected by the barrier is multiplied. This field is applicable
                                                              only for scaled-cost barriers and only if the measurement units are time

    restrictions                                          Optional string. Specify which restrictions should be honored by the tool when finding the best routes 
                                                          between facilities and demand points. A restriction represents a driving
                                                          preference or requirement. In most cases, restrictions cause roads
                                                          to be prohibited. For instance, using an Avoid Toll Roads restriction will result in a route that will 
                                                          include toll roads only when it is absolutely required to travel on toll roads in order to visit an 
                                                          incident or a facility. Height Restriction makes it possible to route around any clearances that are 
                                                          lower than the height of your vehicle. If you are carrying corrosive materials on your vehicle, using 
                                                          the Any Hazmat Prohibited restriction prevents hauling the materials along roads where it is marked as

                                                          Below is a list of available restrictions and a short description.
                                                          Some restrictions require an additional value to be
                                                          specified for their desired use. This value needs to be associated
                                                          with the restriction name and a specific parameter intended to work
                                                          with the restriction. You can identify such restrictions if their
                                                          names appear under the AttributeName column in the Attribute
                                                          Parameter Values parameter. The ParameterValue field should be
                                                          specified in the Attribute Parameter Values parameter for the
                                                          restriction to be correctly used when finding traversable roads.
                                                          Some restrictions are supported only in certain countries; their availability is stated by region in 
                                                          the list below. Of the restrictions that have limited availability within a region, you can check whether 
                                                          the restriction is available in a particular country by looking at the table in the Country List section 
                                                          of the Data coverage for network analysis services web page. If a country has a value of  Yes in the 
                                                          Logistics Attribute column, the restriction with select availability in the region is supported in that country. 
                                                          If you specify restriction names that are not available in the country where your incidents are located, 
                                                          the service ignores the invalid restrictions. The service also ignores restrictions whose Restriction Usage 
                                                          parameter value is between 0 and 1 (see the Attribute Parameter Value parameter). It prohibits all restrictions 
                                                          whose Restriction Usage parameter value is greater than 0.
                                                          The service supports the restriction names listed in the following table:

                                                          parameter to specify whether any restriction prohibits, avoids, or prefers travel on roads that use the
                                                          restriction. If the restriction is meant to avoid or prefer roads, you can further specify the degree
                                                          to which they are avoided or preferred using this parameter. For example, you can choose to never use
                                                          toll roads, avoid them as much as possible, or even highly prefer them.

                                                          The values you provide for this parameter are ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom. If you specify
                                                          the Attribute Parameter Values parameter from a  feature class, the field names on the feature class must
                                                          match the fields as described below:

                                                            * ``ParameterName``: Lists the name of the parameter associated with the
                                                              restriction. A restriction can have one or more ParameterName field
                                                              values based on its intended use.

                                                            * ``ParameterValue``: The value for ParameterName used by the tool
                                                              when evaluating the restriction.

                                                              Attribute Parameter Values is dependent on the Restrictions parameter. The ParameterValue field is
                                                              applicable only if the restriction name is specified as the value for the Restrictions parameter.

                                                              In Attribute Parameter Values, each restriction (listed as AttributeName) has a ParameterName field

                                                              on the roads associated with the restriction and the degree to which the roads are avoided or
                                                              preferred. The Restriction Usage ParameterName can be assigned any of the following string values or
                                                              their equivalent numeric values listed within the parentheses:

                                                                associated with the restriction.

                                                                is somewhat unlikely for the tool to include in the route the roads
                                                                that are associated with the restriction.

                                                                that are associated with the restriction.

                                                                PREFER_MEDIUM (0.5) - It is likely for the tool to include in the route the roads that
                                                                are associated with the restriction.

                                                                PREFER_HIGH (0.2) - It is highly likely for the tool to include in the route the roads
                                                                that are associated with the restriction.

                                                              In most cases, you can use the default value, PROHIBITED, for the Restriction Usage if the restriction
                                                              is dependent on a vehicle-characteristic such as vehicle height. However, in some cases, the value for
                                                              Restriction Usage depends on your routing preferences. For example, the Avoid Toll Roads restriction
                                                              has the default value of AVOID_MEDIUM for the Restriction Usage parameter. This means that when the
                                                              restriction is used, the tool will try to route around toll roads when it can. AVOID_MEDIUM also indicates
                                                              how important it is to avoid toll roads when finding the best route; it has a medium priority. Choosing
                                                              AVOID_LOW would put lower importance on avoiding tolls; choosing AVOID_HIGH instead would give it a higher
                                                              importance and thus make it more acceptable for the service to generate longer routes to avoid tolls.
                                                              Choosing PROHIBITED would entirely disallow travel on toll roads, making it impossible for a route to
                                                              travel on any portion of a toll road. Keep in mind that avoiding or prohibiting toll roads, and thus
                                                              avoiding toll payments, is the objective for some; in contrast, others prefer to drive on toll roads
                                                              because avoiding traffic is more valuable to them than the money spent on tolls. In the latter case, you
                                                              would choose PREFER_LOW, PREFER_MEDIUM, or PREFER_HIGH as the value for Restriction Usage. The higher the
                                                              preference, the farther the tool will go out of its way to travel on the roads associated with the
                                                              restriction.

                                                              generated, then an hour later stores open in Central Time, and so on. Nine o'clock is always in local time

                                                              Therefore, all facilities are reached or departed from simultaneously, regardless of the time zone each is
                                                              in. Setting Time of Day to 2:00 p.m., choosing UTC, then solving causes service areas to be generated for

                                                              Mountain Time Zone, and so on, for facilities in different time zones. The scenario above assumes standard
                                                              time. During daylight saving time, the Eastern, Central, and Mountain Times would each be one hour ahead
                                                              (that is, 10:00, 9:00, and 8:00 a.m., respectively). One of the cases in which the UTC option is useful is
                                                              to visualize emergency-response coverage for a jurisdiction that is split into two time zones. The emergency
                                                              vehicles are loaded as facilities. Time of Day is set to now in UTC. (You need to determine what  the current
                                                              time and date are  in terms of UTC to correctly use this option.) Other properties are set and the analysis
                                                              is solved. Even though a time-zone boundary divides the vehicles, the results show areas that can be reached
                                                              given current traffic conditions. This same process  can be used for other times as well, not just for now.

                                                          Irrespective of the Time Zone for Time of Day setting, all facilities must be in the same time zone
                                                          when Time of Day has a nonnull value and Polygons for Multiple Facilities is set to create merged or

    travel_mode                                           Optional string.  Specify the mode of transportation to model in the analysis. Travel
                                                          modes are managed in ArcGIS Online and can be configured by the administrator of your organization to better
                                                          reflect your organization's workflows. You need to specify the name of a travel mode supported by your
                                                          organization.

                                                          To get a list of supported travel mode names, run the GetTravelModes tool from the Utilities toolbox
                                                          available under the same GIS Server connection you used to access the tool. The GetTravelModes tool
                                                          adds a table, Supported Travel Modes, to the application. Any value in the Travel Mode Name field from the
                                                          Supported Travel Modes table can be specified as input. You can also specify the value from Travel Mode
                                                          Settings field as input. This speeds up the tool execution as the tool does not have to lookup the settings
                                                          based on the travel mode name.

                                                          The default value, Custom, allows you to configure your own travel mode using the custom travel mode
                                                          parameters (UTurn at Junctions, Use Hierarchy, Restrictions, Attribute Parameter Values,  and Impedance).
                                                          The default values of the custom travel mode parameters model travelling by car. You may want to choose
                                                          Custom and set the custom travel mode parameters listed above to model a pedestrian with a fast walking speed
                                                          or a truck with a given height, weight, and cargo of certain hazardous materials. You may choose to do this
                                                          to try out different settings to get desired analysis results. Once you have identified the analysis settings,
                                                          you should work with your organization's administrator and save these settings as part of new or existing
                                                          travel mode so that everyone in your organization can rerun the analysis with the same settings.

    impedance                                             Optional string. Specify the impedance, which is a value that represents the effort or cost
                                                          of traveling along road segments or on other parts of the transportation network.
                                                          Travel distance is an impedance; the length of a road in kilometers can be thought of as impedance. Travel
                                                          distance in this sense is the same for all modes-a kilometer for a pedestrian is also a kilometer for a car.
                                                          (What may change is the pathways on which the different modes are allowed to travel, which affects distance
                                                          between points, and this is modeled by travel mode settings.) Travel time can also be an impedance; a car
                                                          may take one minute to travel a mile along an empty road. Travel times can vary by travel mode-a pedestrian
                                                          may take more than 20  minutes to walk the same mile, so it is important to choose the right impedance for
                                                          the travel mode you are modeling.  Choose from the following impedance values: Drive Time-Models travel times
                                                          for a car. These travel times are dynamic and fluctuate according to traffic flows in areas where traffic data
                                                          is available. This is the default value. Truck Time-Models travel times for a truck.  These travel times are
                                                          static for each road and don't fluctuate with traffic. Walk Time-Models travel times for a pedestrian. Travel
                                                          Distance-Stores  length measurements along roads and paths. To model walk distance, choose this option and
                                                          ensure Walking is  set in the Restriction parameter. Similarly, to model drive or truck distance, choose Travel
                                                          Distance here and set the appropriate restrictions so your vehicle travels only on roads where it is permitted
                                                          to do so. The value you provide for this parameter is ignored unless Travel Mode is set to Custom, which is the
                                                          default value. If you choose Drive Time, Truck Time, or Walk Time, the Measurement Units parameter must be set
                                                          to a time-based value; if you choose Travel Distance for Impedance, Measurement Units must be distance-based.

    save_output_network_analysis_layer                    Optional boolean. Specify if the tool should save the analysis settings as a network analysis layer file. 
                                                          You cannot directly work with this file even when you open the file in an ArcGIS Desktop application like ArcMap.

                                                          True: Save the network analysis layer file. The file is downloaded in a temporary directory on your machine. 
                                                          In ArcGIS Pro, the location of the downloaded file can be determined by viewing the value for the Output Network Analysis

                                                          False: Do not save the network analysis layer file. This is the default.

    overrides                                             Optional string. Specify additional settings that can influence the behavior of the solver when finding solutions 
                                                          for the network analysis problems. The value for this parameter needs to be specified in dict. For example, a valid value is 
                                                          of the following form {"overrideSetting1" : "value1", "overrideSetting2" : 
                                                          "value2"}. The override setting name is always enclosed in double quotes. The values can be a number, Boolean, 
                                                          or string. The default value for this parameter is no value, which indicates not to override any solver settings. Overrides 
                                                          are advanced settings that should be used only after careful analysis of the results obtained before and after applying
