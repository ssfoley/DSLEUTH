"""
The **env** module provides a shared environment used by the different modules.
It stores globals such as the currently active GIS, the default geocoder and so on.
It also stores environment settings that are common among all geoprocessing tools,
such as the output spatial reference.

active_gis
==========

.. py:data:: active_gis
The currently active GIS, that is used for analysis functions unless explicitly specified
when calling the functions.
Creating a new GIS object makes it active unless set_active=False is passed in the GIS constructor.


analysis_extent
===============

.. py:data:: analysis_extent
The processing extent used by analysis tools, specified as an arcgis.geometry.Envelope.

out_spatial_reference
=====================

.. py:data:: out_spatial_reference
The spatial reference of the output geometries. If not specified, the output geometries are in the
spatial reference of the input geometries. If process_spatial_reference is specified and out_spatial_reference
is not specified, the output geometries are in the spatial reference of the process spatial reference.

process_spatial_reference
=========================

.. py:data:: process_spatial_reference
The spatial reference that the geoprocessor will use to perform geometry operations. If specified and
out_spatial_reference is not specified, the output geometries are in the spatial reference of the
process spatial reference.

output_datastore
================

.. py:data:: output_datastore
The data store where GeoAnalytics results should be stored. The supported values of this parameter are "relational" and
"spatiotemporal". By default, results are stored in the spatiotemporal data store. It is recommended that results are
stored in the spatiotemporal data store due to the scalability of the spatiotemporal big data store.

return_z
========

.. py:data:: return_z
If true, Z values will be included in the geoprocessing results if the features have Z values.
Otherwise Z values are not returned. The default is False.


return_m
========

.. py:data:: return_m
If true, M values will be included in the results if the features have M values.
Otherwise M values are not returned. The default is False.

verbose
========

.. py:data:: verbose

If True, messages from geoprocessing tools will be printed to stdout.
In any case, all geoprocessing messages are available through Python logging module.

default_aggregation_styles
==========================

.. py:data:: default_aggregation_styles

Tasks that have the default_aggregation_styles property set to true will set the default aggregations for the
resulting layer. Default aggregations can be square, pointy triangle, flat triangle, pointy hexagon, flat
hexagon, and geohash. All aggregation styles are supported using WKID 4326 (WGS_1984).
The default_aggregation_styles is False. (supported at 10.6.1+)

snap_raster
===========

.. py:data:: snap_raster

Tasks that honor the snap_raster environment will adjust the extent of output rasters
so that they match the cell alignment of the specified snap raster.
(For more information about this environment setting,
please refer to http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/environment-settings/snap-raster.htm)

cell_size
=========

.. py:data:: cell_size

Tasks that honor the Cell size environment setting set the output raster cell size, or resolution,
for the operation.  The default output resolution is determined by the largest cell size of
all the input rasters.
(For more information about this environment setting,
please refer to http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/environment-settings/cell-size.htm)

mask
====

.. py:data:: mask

Tasks that honor the mask environment will only consider those cells that fall within the analysis
mask in the operation
(For more information about this environment setting,
please refer to http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/environment-settings/mask.htm)

parallel_processing_factor
==========================

.. py:data:: parallel_processing_factor

Tasks that honor the parallel_processing_factor environment will divide and perform operations across
multiple processes.
(For more information about this environment setting,
please refer to http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/environment-settings/parallel-processing-factor.htm)
