INTRODUCTION
============

The Python module hostlist.py knows how to expand and collect hostlist
expressions. Example:

  % python
  Python 2.5.1 (r251:54863, Jul 10 2008, 17:24:48) 
  [GCC 4.1.2 20070925 (Red Hat 4.1.2-33)] on linux2
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>> import hostlist
  >>> hosts = hostlist.expand_hostlist("n[1-10,17]")
  >>> hosts
  ['n1', 'n2', 'n3', 'n4', 'n5', 'n6', 'n7', 'n8', 'n9', 'n10', 'n17']
  >>> hostlist.collect_hostlist(hosts)
  'n[1-10,17]'
  >>> hostlist.collect_hostlist(["x1y1","x2y2", "x1y2", "x2y1"])
  'x[1-2]y[1-2]'

Bad hostlists or hostnames will result in the hostlist.BadHostlist
exception being raised.

The 'hostlist' command is provided to expand/collect hostlists and
perform set operations on them. Example:

  % hostlist n[1-10] n[5-20]
  n[1-20]
  % hostlist --difference n[1-10] n[5-20]
  n[1-4]
  % hostlist --expand --intersection n[1-10] n[5-20] 
  n5
  n6
  n7
  n8
  n9
  n10


BUILDING
========

Build RPM packages from the tar.gz archive by running:

  rpmbuild -ta python-hostlist-1.16.tar.gz

If you do not have the tar archive, create it first:

  python setup.py sdist
  rpmbuild -ta dist/python-hostlist-1.16.tar.gz

If you have cloned the git repository, you should also be
able to build RPM packages using "make rpms".

You may also install directly by running the following commands
if you have unpacked a tarball:

  python setup.py build   (as yourself)
  python setup.py install (as root)

If you have cloned the git repository, you will have to do

  make prepare; cd versioned

before building/installing via setup.py.
