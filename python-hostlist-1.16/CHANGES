We take the opportunity to start recording changes in
the spec file %changelog instead.

    Add -s/--separator, -p/--prepend, -a/--append and --version
    options contributed by Pär Andersson at NSC.

    deprecated).

    Add a manual page for hostlist(1).

Version 1.2 (2008-09-18)

    Add "--prefix /usr" in the installation script of the spec file
    (needed on SUSE Linux where the default is /usr/local).
